Let me start by
explaining the

The A button lets
you dig a hole. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
When you dig, you
may find items. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You can view your
items on the

Work goes until
5:00 PM each day. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
If you want to quit
early, just get out
of the site.{PAUSE}{WIPE}

you can't carry your
backpack while {PAUSE}
excavating so make
sure you eat up! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

They were very

advanced. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 47:
The third slate has

Those people's

One day they caught

it?
{CHOICE2 DEF0}
Sure.
No thanks.{EOM}

Message 55:
According to the
fifth slate... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
A great tragedy
happened here. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
The world was ruined
beyond repair and
they had no other {PAUSE}
place to flee but
above ground. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
However, life above
ground didn't agree
with them, and they{PAUSE}
died out one by one. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
They wrote these

they once lived. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

It was built by the
ancient people. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 58:
Oh, right.
We did find this
round looking item. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Apparently you can
listen to sounds
recorded on it. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's like a CD
I guess, but much
heavier. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You can't put it
in a CD player
either... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You should try
finding a scientist
who can help you {PAUSE}
listen to it
somehow... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}
