...Well, you have to
learn to release your
stress. {PAUSE}
Cole: "Do the cattle
get stressed out?"
...Yes, they do.{PAUSE}
Let me tell you about
their stress. {PAUSE}
When they get
stressed out, they
easily get annoyed,{PAUSE}
and they produce
less milk both in
terms of the quality{PAUSE}
and the quantity.
Sometimes they get
sick as well. {PAUSE}
Cole: "I see. But
how do they get
stressed?" {PAUSE}
...For example, if
you keep them in the
barn for a long time,{PAUSE}
or if you keep them
outside in the rain,
and if you ever annoy{PAUSE}
them intentionally,
they'll get unhappy.
Tom: "Just like us."{PAUSE}
Cole: "How do you
make them feel
better?"{PAUSE}
...You can let them
outside when the
weather is nice. {PAUSE}
Don't forget to brush
them and wash them
too. {PAUSE}

milk in the cold

milk as the time goes

Tom: "Do calves drink
the same milk as we

produce special milk.
Tom: "I knew it!"{PAUSE}

anywhere because it's
for calves.

Tom: "Is there any{PAUSE}

closer to the due

Tom: "When does that
start?"{PAUSE}
...Um, about 6 days
prior to the due
date. In the mean{PAUSE}
time, mommy cows have
to eat well. It's
called the{PAUSE}
'dry period'.
Can you guys say it?
Both: "Dry period."{PAUSE}

We can't milk them
during that period.{PAUSE}
Both: "Okay!"

calf, isolate it from{PAUSE}

hear the cattle now!"{PAUSE}
...Cole, can you tell
how that cow is
feeling?{PAUSE}
Cole: "What?! They
are saying some-
thing?"{PAUSE}
...Of course.
Tom: "There is a
variety of moos."{PAUSE}
...Let's learn about
cows' expressions
today.{PAUSE}
{S_3400D1}{S_3204B0}This one is normal.{PAUSE}
{S_320320}{S_3400CE}{S_3204B0}Oh, sounds happy.{PAUSE}

{S_3400D2}{S_3204B0}Tom: "Wow! That

Something might have
happened.{PAUSE}

Today we'll talk
about a variety of{PAUSE}
cows. Do you have a
question, Tom or
Cole?{PAUSE}
Tom: "I saw some cows
with stars on their
forehead at the farm.{PAUSE}
What kind of cows
are they?"
...They must be the{PAUSE}
Star Cows. Their milk
is very good quality.
The milk is good for{PAUSE}
cheese and butter
as well.
Cole: "The Star Cows{PAUSE}
have stars on their
forehead. That's easy
to remember."{PAUSE}
Tom: "And I saw a cow
that looked like a
regular cow but with{PAUSE}
some yellow and
black spots."
...You remember well,{PAUSE}
Tom! The ones with
yellow spots are the
Marble Cows. Their{PAUSE}
milk is good to
make cheese with.
Tom: "So the ones{PAUSE}
with only black spots
are Normal Cows."
...Yes. The quality{PAUSE}
of their milk is not
as good as others,
but they produce{PAUSE}
more milk.
Cole: "Are there any
other kinds?"{PAUSE}
...The Brown Cows are
light brown color,
and their milk is{PAUSE}
good to make butter
with.
Cole: "I see. I wanna{PAUSE}
see them."
Tom: "I wanna drink
all kinds of milk..."{PAUSE}
...Oh, Tom.
See you next time!{EOM}{EOM}

Today we'll talk
about the fields.{PAUSE}
Do you guys have a
question, Syd or
Jack?{PAUSE}
Syd: "Can we plant
seeds anywhere?"{PAUSE}
...No, you have to
sow the seeds in a
prepared field. {PAUSE}
Syd: "I see. What
does it look like?"
...You see a section{PAUSE}
in the farm with good
soil. You have to
till the soil and{PAUSE}
plant the seeds.
Jack: "Can you grow
any kind of crops?"{PAUSE}
...Not really. Some
crops need better
soil than others,{PAUSE}

Today we'll talk
about watering.{PAUSE}
Do you guys have a
question, Syd or

Jack: "So if you sow
the seeds, do they
start growing?"{PAUSE}
...They don't grow
unless you water
them.{PAUSE}
Syd: "How do you
water them?"
...Use your{PAUSE}
Watering Can.
Jack: "How often
do we need to water{PAUSE}
them?"
...Well, you have to
figure it out by{PAUSE}
looking at the soil.
Water the field when
the soil is dry.{PAUSE}
Jack: "What happens
if I forget?"
...If you don't water{PAUSE}
well, the seeds won't
sprout, and even if
they did, they could{PAUSE}
wither. So, you
have to water the
field everyday.{PAUSE}
Twice a day will do.

The flowers and then
the crops.{PAUSE}

then."{PAUSE}

that's correct.

underground.{PAUSE}

know when to harvest
the root crops?"{PAUSE}
...The flowers of the
root crops will wilt
after a while. Then{PAUSE}
just pull them out.
