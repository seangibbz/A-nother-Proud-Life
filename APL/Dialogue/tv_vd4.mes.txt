Today, I've finally

Rupan, whom I've been
chasing for years.{PAUSE}
Slide: "Rupan! We've

Give yourself up!"
Rupan: "So you think
you've got the place{PAUSE}
totally covered, eh?
You've still got a
lot to learn pal.{PAUSE}
Watch this!"
I had cornered Rupan
at the top of the{PAUSE}
building... But, he
flew away using
a hang glider.{PAUSE}
Slide: "Darn it! How
did he...!? I have to
let things slide{PAUSE}
again...?"
Just as I was giving
up, it seemed that{PAUSE}
Fate was on my side
today! Suddenly a
strong gust of wind{PAUSE}
blew upwards!
Rupan: "Ahhh, dang!!"
The wind of Justice{PAUSE}
snapped the glider in
half and dropped
Rupan in front of me.{PAUSE}
Slide: "Ha ha ha!
So much for your
amazing escape!"{PAUSE}
Rupan: "I can't
believe I'm getting

Detective Slide.{PAUSE}
Today, I went skiing
on my day off.
I ended up being{PAUSE}
snowed in during
a blizzard. On top of
that, I got roped{PAUSE}
into a murder
mystery!{PAUSE}
Slide: "But, at the
time of the incident,
everyone was eating{PAUSE}
dinner... And the
victim was stabbed in
the back, so that{PAUSE}
rules out the idea of
suicide. Which brings
me back to my{PAUSE}
original question.
Where did the murder
weapon go?"{PAUSE}
Everyone says they
were at dinner,
but people came and{PAUSE}
went all night.
They went to the
bathroom, they went{PAUSE}
to take medicine,
answer the phone,
etc...{PAUSE}
Each time they had a
brief moment, they
could have made their{PAUSE}
move!
Slide: "Everyone here
seems innocent.{PAUSE}
Looks like I have no
choice but to
let things slide...?"{PAUSE}
At that time I had
began to think that

escaped into the
snowy mountains.

the missing weapon{PAUSE}
was found. The staff

soaked in blood.{PAUSE}
Slide: "Where did you
get this?"{PAUSE}
Staff: "From Mr. A's
room..."{PAUSE}
All 9 people there
turned to look at
Mr. A.{PAUSE}
Mr. A: "I-it's not
me! I've got a rock
solid alibi, and I{PAUSE}
know that B has the
key to the room!"
Mr. B: "W-what are{PAUSE}
you saying! My alibi
is perfect, and on
top of that the key{PAUSE}
was stolen from me!
C's alibi is pretty
weak! I know she was{PAUSE}
dumped by the victim
recently!"
Ms. C: "Hey, I really{PAUSE}
had to go to the
restroom! If you're
looking for who stole{PAUSE}
the key, it was
Mr. D! I saw him when
I was going to the{PAUSE}

Mr. D: "M-me!?
No way! Sure I stole{PAUSE}
the key to steal
money, but E knocked
me out and took the{PAUSE}
key from me!"
Mr. E: "No! Sure I
hit him, but..." {PAUSE}
Mr. F: "Enough! I
can't take it
anymore!!"{PAUSE}
Everyone became
silent when F
cried out.{PAUSE}

him! There you got{PAUSE}
me!!"
Slide: "Um, what
about an alibi{PAUSE}
and the knife?"
Mr. F: "After using
the knife I hid{PAUSE}
it in A's room.
I did it during the

answering my cell
phone."
Slide: "I see...now{PAUSE}

you can't get a cell

I had heard that the

Rupan, had escaped.{PAUSE}
So, today I've come
to his rumored

to justice once and
for all.
Slide: "Is he really{PAUSE}

away this time!"{PAUSE}

you can, loser!!"{PAUSE}
Once again the chase
