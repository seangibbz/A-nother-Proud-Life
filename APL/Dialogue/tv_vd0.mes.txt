Today I went out in
search of a big one.{PAUSE}
I rode my small boat
overcoming the
crashing waves{PAUSE}
to a fishing spot
where I could only
hear the sound of{PAUSE}
the waves and the
soft cry of the
gulls.{PAUSE}
Observing the bird's
movements, I tossed
out some bait and{PAUSE}
watched it sink deep
into the ocean.{PAUSE}
All that was left
was to sit and
wait for it...{PAUSE}
The shining sun was
very hot.{PAUSE}
Every nerve in my
fingers were eager
in anticipation.{PAUSE}
I could see my line
being moved by the
fish...{PAUSE}
...fhzzzzz...
fhzzzzz...
Now!{PAUSE}
As I reeled my line
in, I could feel
my catch hooked.{PAUSE}
Not a bad Bonito...{PAUSE}
Taking my catch up
into my boat,
I immediately began{PAUSE}
to bind and secure
it thoroughly.{PAUSE}
I then turned it
into bait for an
even BIGGER fish and{PAUSE}
tossed it back to
the ocean.{PAUSE}
The real contest has
only just begun.

The Bonito was quite
lively... It made for
good bait...{PAUSE}
It was only a matter
of time before a big
one would take it.{PAUSE}
My fingers twitched
in anticipation.{PAUSE}
My line was telling
me what was going on
in the water...{PAUSE}
But it was no avail.
Nothing larger took
the bait.{PAUSE}
Even the birds had
vanished.{PAUSE}
The setting sun
reflected it's last
rays on the calm{PAUSE}
water.{PAUSE}
My spirit sank, and
I was getting tired.{PAUSE}
The sun was just
about gone. I had to
go home soon...{PAUSE}
...!! {PAUSE}
Suddenly, my line
began to pull
violently!!{PAUSE}
It was a battle
between me and the
rod.{PAUSE}
Would I pull the
catch in, or would
the catch pull me in?{PAUSE}
It had to be huge!!

It had been a long
time since I had
savored the sweet{PAUSE}
taste of a battle
between myself and
a big one.{PAUSE}
But, this one was
different.{PAUSE}
It pulled and yanked
at my line as if to
sink the boat.{PAUSE}
I don't even know how
much time passed.{PAUSE}
By the time the fish
calmed down, the
light of the moon{PAUSE}
reflected off of my
boat.{PAUSE}
My numb fingers
pulled in my prey. It
felt as if I was{PAUSE}
dragging in a huge
boulder out of the
watery depths.{PAUSE}
But little by little
I carefully reeled
in my prize.{PAUSE}
From the waters I
could see the
shimmering orange{PAUSE}
color of my catch.
Now, both the sky and
the sea were dyed{PAUSE}
orange by the rising
sun.{PAUSE}
As I pulled it up
ever closer,
the size increased.{PAUSE}
It was even bigger
than my boat!{PAUSE}
I couldn't bring it
inside the boat...{PAUSE}
Having no other
choice I lashed
it to the keel.{PAUSE}
It was surely a
Marlin easily over
1000 pounds!{PAUSE}
Catching it was
hard and taking
it home was even{PAUSE}
harder... How far did
this fish pull me?

moving on it's own.{PAUSE}
There was no wind,
so...why?{PAUSE}

It was the fish!{PAUSE}
It's tail was moving
back and forth. I
couldn't believe it.{PAUSE}
It was still alive!?{PAUSE}
All I cared about was
that the boat was
moving, though.{PAUSE}
...Soon enough, I
stared seeing
the land.{PAUSE}

reached land at last.{PAUSE}

It was the perfect
season for Trout
fishing.{PAUSE}
I had no doubt that

this day.{PAUSE}
I went to a river
where the current
was fast and the sand{PAUSE}
was firm. I tied my
line to my pole.{PAUSE}
Facing the sun, I
cast it into the
river, in the{PAUSE}
direction of

It shouldn't take
long. I could have
just gone to another{PAUSE}
place if I didn't get
a bite here.
But... I got one!{PAUSE}
It was a good one
too. Pulling with all

Today I went off in
search of Carp.{PAUSE}
To catch Carp, the
first thing you need
to have is patience.{PAUSE}
After finding a good
spot to fish, you
need to go there{PAUSE}
everyday and bring
your bait.{PAUSE}
When the Carp have
gathered nearby,
start fishing.{PAUSE}
Carp only show up
during the early
morning or the late{PAUSE}
evening.
After tossing in the
bait, all you can do{PAUSE}
is to wait...{PAUSE}
Wait...wait...
sometimes for
2 or even 3 days...{PAUSE}
If you are lucky, you
may catch a great big
Carp someday.{PAUSE}

catch Carp.{PAUSE}

Today I went out to
catch some Salmon.{PAUSE}
In the hotter seasons
Salmon ascend
upstream.{PAUSE}
Aim at the bottom of
a big river, right in
the middle.{PAUSE}
It's best to use
Salmon Roe as bait.
After tossing it in,{PAUSE}
wait a while.
They'll be biting in
no time.{PAUSE}
If you get a big
catch, your line will
pull out.{PAUSE}
Then a great fight
between man and
fish begins.{PAUSE}
Reel in the line with
a steady hand
and drag him in.{PAUSE}
If you strain with
every last ounce
of energy, you'll see{PAUSE}
his silvery body rise
above the water's
surface.{PAUSE}
It might even be the
great King Salmon.{PAUSE}
If you're able to
pull it off, your
dinner table will be{PAUSE}
graced with delicious
Salmon Steak.
