We've gone off to the

.....................{PAUSE}
The Shikura Sea is
the Monkey Weeds'
natural habitat. {PAUSE}
In the middle of it,
there is an island
called "Komori",{PAUSE}
which you cannot find
on any maps.
The Yan-Yan Pond is{PAUSE}
located somewhere
on this island, and
it is the home of{PAUSE}
the Water Monkeys.
                     {PAUSE}
We've entered the
deepest parts of
Komori Island chasing{PAUSE}
after the elusive
Water Monkey.
The surface of the{PAUSE}
island was formed
from a volcanic
eruption. At first{PAUSE}
glance, there seems
no life.
Just where is the{PAUSE}
world is this
Yan-Yan Pond?
We began our journey{PAUSE}
in search of the pond
first.
Originally the{PAUSE}
Yan-Yan Pond was
discovered about{PAUSE}
100 years ago by
Joseph Nehit.
His diary is the only{PAUSE}
written record
we have of his
exploits. This is{PAUSE}
what was inside his
diary.
                    {PAUSE}
I could hear the
sound in the middle
of the night. {PAUSE}
"Yan-yan" it went.
I followed the noise
until I came{PAUSE}

We waited for night{PAUSE}

hear a very soft and
faint sound.
"Yan-yan, yan-yan..."{PAUSE}
we heard it say.
Relying on the moon-
light, we journeyed{PAUSE}
in the direction of
the sound. As we
moved closer we heard{PAUSE}
scratching from the
various openings
around us. {PAUSE}
The sound was
emanating from the
holes in the volcanic{PAUSE}
rocks. After
listening a while, we
then realized it{PAUSE}
wasn't just any sound,
it was the "yan-yan"
sound. {PAUSE}
Having found a
slightly larger
opening, we entered.{PAUSE}
Inside led to a much
narrower cave.
The moon illuminated{PAUSE}
the inside with
a beam of light.

We continued down the

Unbelievably deep{PAUSE}
inside was an amazing

A dome about 150 feet

stretched out before{PAUSE}
us, reflecting light
as if the moon had

According to my

somebody. {PAUSE}

it's right there. {PAUSE}
One's over there."

Over there too? {PAUSE}
I don't see any

Villager: "Of course{PAUSE}
ya don't see any
trees. They're
walking trees. {PAUSE}
See, one over there,
and right there."
Rimera: "I still{PAUSE}
don't see them.
Where in the world
are they?" {PAUSE}
Villager: "You're a

ya? They're all{PAUSE}
around!"
...Let's ask another
person, shall we?{PAUSE}
Rimera: "Excuse me,
do you know where I
can find the walking{PAUSE}

Walking Tree: "We're
the Walking Trees. {PAUSE}
We were once normal
trees, but we've
evolved enough to be{PAUSE}

Everyone here is a
Walking Tree." {PAUSE}

"The Walking Trees".
.....................{PAUSE}
Do you believe that
trees can walk?
Not just walk, but{PAUSE}
walk around the
center of town like
they own the place? {PAUSE}
It is this story that
I, Geraldo Rimera,
Star Reporter have{PAUSE}
come to share with
you all.
....................{PAUSE}


According to my
sources, this is the
place... {PAUSE}
I see people walking
around, but I don't
see any trees around{PAUSE}
here at all...
I'm going to ask
somebody. {PAUSE}
Rimera: "Excuse me,
have you seen any
walking trees around{PAUSE}
here recently?"
Villager: "Yeah,
it's right there. {PAUSE}
One's over there."
Rimera: "Right there?
Over there too? {PAUSE}
I don't see any
around here, but..."
Villager: "Of course{PAUSE}
ya don't see any
trees. They're
walking trees. {PAUSE}
See, one over there,
and right there."
Rimera: "I still{PAUSE}
don't see them.
Where in the world
are they?" {PAUSE}
Villager: "You're a
strange one, aren't
ya? They're all{PAUSE}
around!"
...Let's ask another
person, shall we?{PAUSE}
Rimera: "Excuse me,
do you know where I
can find the walking{PAUSE}
trees around here?"
Walking Tree: "We're
the Walking Trees. {PAUSE}
We were once normal
trees, but we've
evolved enough to be{PAUSE}
able to walk.
Everyone here is a
Walking Tree." {PAUSE}
...It doesn't seem
like asking anyone
else will help... {PAUSE}
We'll just call it
quits for now.
....................{PAUSE}
A job well done,
Rimera.
Seems like a very{PAUSE}
eccentric village.
Until next time!{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

....................{PAUSE}
Investigative

on the scene. {PAUSE}
We've come to shed
light on the rumors
about the mysterious{PAUSE}
stairs in this
building. Seems as if
nobody living here...{PAUSE}
All the rooms are
lined up, doesn't
seem to be any stairs{PAUSE}
around here. I'm
going into one of
the rooms. {PAUSE}
The inside of the
room is...Oh!
There's the stairs. {PAUSE}
I'm now going to try
climbing them.
Hmmm...{PAUSE}
Doesn't seem like
anything changed.
The room above is the{PAUSE}
same as the last one.
Oh, there's another
set of stairs. {PAUSE}
I'll climb up them
and see...
Well...{PAUSE}


...Maybe we're in a
wrong building...
Nothing really{PAUSE}
changed again.
Same room and more
stairs... {PAUSE}
I'll take a quick
walk outside.
It's the same hallway{PAUSE}
I came in...?
It's the same
entrance I came in{PAUSE}
as well...
Could it be...?
Could it possibly...?{PAUSE}


Waaaah!!
I've gone outside!
I climbed up 2{PAUSE}
flights of starts,
but exited the room!
I'm back on the 1st{PAUSE}
floor... I'm gonna
try that again.
This time I'll try it{PAUSE}
from another room.

This time we bring

the "Village of
Longevity".
.....................{PAUSE}
We'd heard about a
village where people
have lived longer{PAUSE}
than anywhere else in
the world. We've sent
out our ace reporter, {PAUSE}
Geraldo Rimera to
investigate it.
As expected, after{PAUSE}
walking around the
village, I've seen
only elderly people{PAUSE}
around. Let's go up
and introduce
ourselves. {PAUSE}
Rimera: "Excuse me,
sir..."
Old Man: "Hmm?" {PAUSE}
Rimera: "Just how old
are you, sir?"
Old Man: "I'm 100{PAUSE}
years old, sonny."
Rimera: "Oh, my you
have lived so long."{PAUSE}
Old Man: "I'm the
oldest one in the
village." {PAUSE}
Rimera: "I see...
Let's interview
someone else." {PAUSE}
Other Old Man: "Hey,
you. I'm 105 and the
oldest here." {PAUSE}
Rimera: "Is that so?"
Old Man: "What're ya
talking about? {PAUSE}
Well then... I'm 110!
Beat that!"
Other Old Man: "Oh, {PAUSE}
yeah? I'm 120!"
Old Woman: "You two,
stop fighting. {PAUSE}
Everyone knows I'm
the oldest.
After all I'm 132."{PAUSE}
Old Man: "Truth be
told, I'm 148!
Didn't know that, {PAUSE}
did ya?"
Old Woman: "Well, if
you're 148, {PAUSE}
then I'm 158!"
Other Old Man: "You
can't beat me! {PAUSE}
I'm 160 years old!"
Rimera: "Um...
guys...?" {PAUSE}
Old Man: "Listen to
me, son. You'd better
believe I'm really{PAUSE}
170."
Old Woman: "Oh yeah,
well, I'm 200 years{PAUSE}
old!"
Other Old Man: "Oh,
yeah? Then I'm..."{PAUSE}
...A village of
longevity indeed...
We'll just leave it{PAUSE}
at that for now.
.....................{PAUSE}
That was certainly
some village.
