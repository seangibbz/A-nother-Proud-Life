myself. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 498:
That looks pretty
good, {PETE}.
{CHOICE2 DEF0}
Here you go.
It's all for me.{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 499:
{FACE_020003}Really?
Thanks a lot! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 500:
Tell me the recipe
sometime. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I'm quite a cook,
too, you know. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 501:
Let me know if you
make anything else
good! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 502:
What a strange hoe!
Does it work like a
regular one? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 503:
I want one like
that, too! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 504:
That's a rare type of
hoe! How does it
work? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 505:
So you like to
grow crops? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 506:
Is that your hoe?
Doesn't look
very used. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 507:
Use it more.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 508:
Is that the hoe you
are using? The one I
use is much older! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 509:
That hoe has
potential - you just
need to break it in!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 510:
You've broken that
hoe in quite well! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 511:
{FACE_020001}You sure are
working hard.
Impressive! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 512:
That sickle sure is
an odd shape... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 513:
It looks pretty
sharp, but you
shouldn't carry {PAUSE}
it around, you know?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 514:
Now that's an unusual
sickle! Know how to
use it? {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 515:
I'd like to try
using it myself. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Is it any different
from regular ones?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 516:
That sickle is
brand new,
isn't it? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 517:
You haven't used it
much yet, but when
you do, it'll get {PAUSE}
even better at
cutting. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 518:
Is that your sickle?
Mine is much more
broken in than that!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 519:
You shouldn't carry
it around, you know.
That's dangerous! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 520:
That sickle looks
pretty well worn in.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
You've got to take
good care of it, or
it'll rust. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 521:
I'm impressed with
what you've done
with that sickle! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 522:
I've never seen a
watering can like
that! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
How does it work? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 523:
What a nice
watering can you
have!{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 524:
It must be fun to
water with such a
new watering can! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 525:
You do use that
watering can, right? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
It looks virtually
unused... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 526:
Nice watering can,
{PETE}. Do
you like using it? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 527:
You've got to adjust
your watering to the
crop's condition. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 528:
What a wonderfully
broken in watering
can that is! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 529:
You must have used it
a lot to get it this
well worn in! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 530:
A new milker! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 531:
I hope you get lots
of use out of it! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 532:
That machine's
for milking cows,
right? {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 533:
It must be nice to
have fresh milk
all the time! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 534:
That's a cow milker,
isn't it? It looks
pretty old... {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 535:
If you're going to
use a milker, it
should be clean.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 536:
Those are for
shearing sheep,
right? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
That must be
a tough job! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 537:
Shearing sheep
must be such
hard work... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 538:
It must be fun to
shear sheap with
those! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 539:
Shearing sheep looks
like fun! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 540:
Is this the season
for shearing sheep? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 541:
Don't the sheep catch
colds without their
coats...? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 542:
Those clippers look
pretty well used.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
You must be
pretty good by now.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 543:
I think sheep look
cute without their
coats! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 544:
I just love shiny
new tools! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 545:
I always find
excuses to use new
tools! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 546:
Going to do some
work? Good job. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 547:
We've both got a
lot of work to do. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 548:
Did you break this
tool in all by
yourself? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 549:
Isn't it great to
break in a tool all
by yourself, until {PAUSE}
it fits your hand
just perfectly? {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 550:
What a beautiful
stone. Are you
going to sell it? {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 551:
That's very pretty! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 552:
What a funny thing
you have there? Are
you going to sell it?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 553:
Guys like things
like that,
don't they? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 554:
Is that wild? Where
did you pick it? {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 555:
Don't pick too much! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 556:
Wow, a record! Do
you own a record
player? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 557:
I love listening to
music... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 558:
{S_340193}Did you get that
from {RUBY}? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 559:
{RUBY} is such a
good cook. I'd love
to learn from her!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 560:
{S_340193}What a lovely medal!
I bet it was
{WALLY}'s. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 561:
If it were mine, I'd
like to keep it... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 562:
...
That has a nice
decoration...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 563:
Take good care
of this now! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 564:
Oh, {LUMINA} gave
it to you.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
I think she wants you
to keep it until
she's ready.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 565:
Keep it and give it
back to {LUMINA}
when she's ready.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 566:
{S_340194}...!
You surprised me!{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Is there gunpowder
in that?! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 567:
Just try not to burn
yourself with those
fireworks! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 568:
What are you doing
with it? {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 569:
If it's something
valuable, keep it
in a safe place.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 570:
When I was a child
living in {C14}{STRUC_31}{C17},
{VESTA} used to bring{PAUSE}
us fresh vegetables.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 571:
Everybody was against
me coming here with
{VESTA}. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 572:
I'm glad I came to
{C14}{STRUC_30}{C17},
though it means {PAUSE}
being away from my
parents... {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 573:
The {VAR_00} you
gave me was great!
I loved it. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 574:
Remember the
{VAR_00} you
gave me? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You know they're
hard to grow...?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 575:
That {VAR_00} you
gave me was really
good. I'm impressed. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 576:
The {VAR_00} you
gave me was
delicious. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Even {VESTA}
was impressed! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 577:
The {VAR_00}
was great.
Thanks a lot. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 578:
The {VAR_00}
was great.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Will you give me
the recipe sometime?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 579:
The {VAR_00}
was great.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
You're turning into
quite a cook! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 580:
I ate the
{VAR_00} you
gave me. Thanks. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 581:
{FACE_020003}I hear you're doing a
great job on the farm
lately! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 582:
The vegetables you

I have a lot to
learn from you! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 583:
Since you're such a
good cook, will you
teach me sometime? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 584:
It's great you can
run the farm so well
all by yourself! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 585:
Raising crops isn't
easy, but you're
doing a great job. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You're kind of an
inspiration to me... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 586:
Do you cook a lot?
I hear your food

He'll grow up healthy
and happy on the {PAUSE}
farm, that's for
sure! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 593:
I wasn't very healthy
as a child, so
looking at {TATSUYA} {PAUSE}
makes me happy. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 594:
{TATSUYA}'s gotten
so big! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I wonder if he'll
take over the farm? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}
