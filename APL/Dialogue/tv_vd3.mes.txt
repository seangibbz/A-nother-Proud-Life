Hello everyone.
It's time for another
Music Moment. {PAUSE}
Today we're doing
a special show
featuring composer{PAUSE}
McCoy G.
When one thinks of
McCoy G, you have{PAUSE}
to think of his song,
"Mistake". Though not
many know this, the{PAUSE}
truth is the song was
originally meant to
be an instrumental.{PAUSE}
McCoy G isn't only
a songwriter, he's
also a virtuoso of{PAUSE}
the Oguracci as well.
It seems that
"Mistake" was{PAUSE}
originally created to
be performed on
the Oguracci. {PAUSE}
Although "Mistake" is
easy to sing, the
real difficult parts{PAUSE}
of the song are
it's incredibly high
tones. {PAUSE}
Although it takes a
great deal of skill
in order to produce{PAUSE}
notes in that range,
when applied to
instruments, the end{PAUSE}
result is quite
pleasing. So, as we
say goodbye for today{PAUSE}
let's all listen to
the instrumental
version of "Mistake".{PAUSE}
Until next time.
Take care everyone!{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

imagine that it's the{PAUSE}
emotion of the song
entering your body.
Mary: "★♥○×"{PAUSE}
Chechehof: "♥♀★○"
Mary: "Yes, you could
say that." {PAUSE}
