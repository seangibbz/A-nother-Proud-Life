Message 0:
Thank you! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I'll show you the
location right
away. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 1:
This is the
entrance. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Only a small part of
it has been studied,
but you can help us.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 2:
Let me start by
explaining the
basics. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
The A button let's
you dig a square. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
When you dig, you
may find items. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You can view your
items on the
Relic Screen. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Work goes until
5:00 PM each day. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
If you want to quit
earlier, just go
up the stairs. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
One more thing,
you can't carry your
backpack while {PAUSE}
excavating so make
sure you eat up! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 3:
Do I need to explain
it to you again?
{CHOICE3 DEF0}
Explain again.
That's enough.
Never mind.{EOM}

Work hard, but
not too hard. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 6:
Thanks a lot.
That's enough for
today. {PAUSE}
Oh, I'll take any
items you may have
found. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 7:
Hmm... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
This isn't enough
to figure anything
out yet. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 8:
Oh, it's you!
I've been waiting
for you. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 9:
Thanks to you, we're
able to begin to
understand more {PAUSE}
of the riddle of
the {C14}{STRUC_41}{C17}.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Unfortunately, we
still don't know
everything yet... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 10:
But that's no reason
to give up!{PAUSE}{WIPE}
As long as we make
progress, we may
yet understand!{PAUSE}{WIPE}
So, can you help us
today again?
{CHOICE2 DEF0}

Oh!
It's you!
Glad you came. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 14:
I've found something
incredible! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
This is still just
a guess at this
point so I won't{PAUSE}
go spreading it
all over the place. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You on the other
hand, have a right
to know. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
The truth is,
I've found something
among the fossils{PAUSE}
we've excavated.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
What do you think
that is? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 15:
Exactly.
However! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
At first glance,
they might be the
remains of dinosaurs {PAUSE}
that once lived in
the watery depths! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
But there's more!
Something bigger! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
We found picture
writing depicting
mermaids! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
This could be the
lost relics of
a people who once {PAUSE}
lived in the depths
of the seas! {PAUSE}{WIPE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 16:
We must continue
our work and strive
for answers!{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Answers to this
ancient mystery!{PAUSE}{WIPE}
As long as we

This is the first

felt like this. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Achoooo!! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 21:
Sorry. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I'm so sick I won't
be able to do any
excavating today. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
But, we can't give
up now.
Achooo!! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You're the only one
I can depend on! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I'm sorry to ask
this of you, but

today?

Hmm.

Message 25:
Hmm.
So that's it... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
The reason we got
sick was because
of the curse! {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 26:
H-hey you, what are
you so panicked
about? {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 27:
What?
You're afraid of a
little curse? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
There's no need
to worry. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Even if we fell,
you were still
okay, right? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
From what I've seen
you're our man
for the job. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Let's just continue
our progress and
not worry about it. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 28:
Oh, one more thing.
The place where
we're currently {PAUSE}
digging appears
to continue on to
the King's Hall. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
There's a chance
of finding some
great relics there. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Proceed with great
care. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
We're so close to
unraveling the
mystery! {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I'm sorry to ask
this of you but

today?

You want to know?
Allow me to explain
it to you. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 31:
Up ahead is the
Tomb of the King. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's said that those
who would enter such
holy grounds is {PAUSE}
doomed by great
misfortune. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Now that I think
about it, that could
be the reason why {PAUSE}
Flora and I suddenly
got sick. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's all because of
the curse! {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 32:
Oh!
Thanks for coming! {PAUSE}{EOM}

finish our dig. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
We owe you a debt
of gratitude. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 34:
This what I've been
able to conclude. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
As I had expected,
this place was once
the {C14}{STRUC_41}{C17}{PAUSE}
of a thriving ancient
civilization. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 35:
As far as the disk
looking item you
had found... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
It was able to
play back musical
data that was {PAUSE}
inscribed on it. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
The best way to
explain it is to
compare it to a CD. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I imagine any
researcher would
be happy to have it. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 36:
It seems they were
trying to warn us of
something... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Our planet's is in
