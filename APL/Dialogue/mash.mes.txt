Message 161:
{FACE_1E0003}You're trying so
hard to make things

I'd say that you've
become a great farmer
at this point. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 162:
{FACE_1E0003}You've really put
a lot of energy into
your fields... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You put me to
shame. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 163:
{FACE_1E0003}I heard that you're
a good cook. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Planning on being
the next Iron Cook? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 164:
It really looks like
you're working hard.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Your farm could
exist securely at
this point. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 165:
Are you putting in
the effort needed
for the fields? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's easier said
than done. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 166:
Are you putting in
your energies into
cooking...? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Is that better
than the fields? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 167:
{FACE_1E0009}Looks like you're
starting to get the
hang of farm work. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
{S_340191}It's just beginning
for you... {PAUSE}{EOM}

You better take

I guess your right.
I was just curious.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 174:
I don't think I was
meant for work out
in the fields. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
There must be a good
job for me somewhere
out there. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Still, without me,
who would tend
the fields...? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 175:
I don't think I was
meant for work out
in the fields. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Still, I do like
working with crops. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Especially when it
comes to breeding of
different crops. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 176:
Breeding of crops is
when you splice DNA
from one crop into {PAUSE}
another crop to
create something
entirely new. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
If you mix a tomato
with a watermelon,
you get {CROP_0005}. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Or if you mix a
melon with a
strawberry... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Then you'll get
a crop called the
{CROP_000A}. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
You could even mix
the {CROP_0005} with
the {CROP_000A} {PAUSE}
and get a brand new
crop again. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 177:
Now that I think
about it, this life
isn't so bad. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's not always the
most stimulating
lifestyle here,{PAUSE}
but still it's not
a bad one either. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 178:
I think Daryl might
be doing some kind
of research on {PAUSE}
selective breeding
of crops and such. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I wonder what he
may have created... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 179:
If I could create
a good crop, I might
be useful to Vesta. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 180:
Forget-Me-Not Valley
really suits me
the best. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 181:
I relax so much when
I'm here. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 182:

never be chased
out of here. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 183:

something from
me? {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 184:
{S_340191}I hope you didn't
come just to kill
time with me... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

busy... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
{FACE_1E0003}Now, this place
is all I need. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 191:
{S_340190}{FACE_1E0009}Everyday it's a
little hot in
the Summer. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 192:
{S_340190}{FACE_1E0009}Everyday is hot...
Maybe I should go to
the ocean everyday? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 193:
Not hot...not cold...
{FACE_1E0003}My kind of season. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

This season really
deserves the title
"Harvest Time". {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 195:
{S_340190}{FACE_1E0009}......
Everyday is a little
cold in the Winter. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 196:
{S_340190}{FACE_1E0009}This constant cold
everyday isn't
good for my body. {PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 197:
What do you think
of our field? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I really do wonder
what someone like
you thinks... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 198:
{S_340190}{FACE_1E0009}You probably came
here because you
liked the place, {PAUSE}
I didn't expect
to come out here
and do field work. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 199:
When you do breed
crops together,
you'll get a similar{PAUSE}
shape or color
as a result of
the combination. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Sometimes though,
you'll get something
entirely different. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 200:
{FACE_1E0003}I feel like my body
is getting
healthier... {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 201:

anything about her? {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 207:
{FACE_1E0002}Stay out of {CELIA}'s
business. {PAUSE}{WIPE}
{CELIA} is a
very serious girl. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 208:
{FACE_1E0007}What am I supposed
to do now...? {PAUSE}{WIPE}
Huh...?
Oh, never mind...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 209:
{FACE_1E0004}You just seem
stupidly happy... {PAUSE}{WIPE}
I'm sure {CELIA}
will rethink the
marriage. {PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}
