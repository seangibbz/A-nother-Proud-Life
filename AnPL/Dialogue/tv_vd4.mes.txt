I got in my car and started after him,

   the key--I was looking for money--but
   E beat me up and took it from me!”{PAUSE}
Mr. E: “Nuh-uh! I did beat you up, but...”
Mr. F: “That's enough! Just stop it!”
The room fell silent at F's heated shout.{PAUSE}
Mr. F: “I found the key and killed the guy
   'cause I had a grudge against him!
   Happy now?”{PAUSE}
Waitensee: “But your alibi--the weapon...”{PAUSE}
Mr. F: “I brought the knife in and hid it
   in A's room when I was done with it--
   while he was answering his cellphone.”{PAUSE}
Waitensee: “Oh, yeah...I guess cellphones
   work fine in a snowstorm...”
The blizzard was slowing down.{PAUSE}
So it was that I was able to solve
a tricky locked-room murder with
my very own wait-and-see technique.{PAUSE}
...To be continued...{EOM}{EOM}

Message 23:
“Detective Waitensee”
Finale: “Norepaso Returns”{PAUSE}
They call me Detective Waitensee.
When I heard the thief Norepaso had
escaped after I'd finally captured him,{PAUSE}
I went to the place rumor said his
hideout was most likely to be found.
Waitensee: “Are you in there?”{PAUSE}
Norepaso: “Ack! It's Waitensee!”
When I peeked into the window, I found
myself eye to eye with Norepaso!{PAUSE}
Waitensee: “You won't get away this time!”
Norepaso: “See you later, alligator!”
His car smashed out through the window.{PAUSE}
Waitensee: “Hey, watch it, pal!”
Norepaso: “Come and get me, copper!”
And with that, he roared away.{PAUSE}
I got in my car and started after him,
but I never thought I could catch up.
Waitensee: “I guess that's that...”{PAUSE}
I figured I'd just have to wait and see...
That's when I spotted Norepaso just ahead.
Waitensee: “What are you doing?”{PAUSE}
Norepaso: “I-I guess I hit some
   window glass on my way out of the
   hideout...I have a flat tire...”{PAUSE}
So it was that I succeeded once more
at catching the thief Norepaso.
All you have to do is wait and see.{PAUSE}
