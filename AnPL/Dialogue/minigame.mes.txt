All right, let me explain how to do it.
Press the {C14}A Button{C17} to clean the grave.
But you can't just do it any old way.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
You have to do it gently and put your
whole heart into it.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But you can't take all day, either.
Try your best to finish cleaning it
in 60 seconds.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
All right, here we go.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 11:
Let me explain how to play the game.
Just press the {C14}A Button{C17}.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
The more times you press the {C14}A Button{C17},
the more milk you can drink.
Simple, huh?â™ª{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 12:
OK, here we go.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I see. That's too bad.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 21:
Really? Great!
You've made an old man happy!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 22:
Should I explain the game's rules?{CHOICE Y/N DEF0}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 23:
All right, let's start the game.
I'll go first.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 24:
OK, here are the rules.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 25:
OK, I'll explain the rules again.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 26:
We each take turns placing lines on the
board to capture territory.{?_39}{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 27:
You can move the cursor with the Control
Stick or the + Control Pad.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
If you press the {C12}B Button{C17} while
moving the cursor, you can
move it faster.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Press the {C14}A Button{C17} to place a line.{?_39}{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 28:
When you surround an area with your
lines, it becomes your territory.{S_3203E8}{?_39}{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 29:
Oh, I almost forgot. You can only put
lines in places where there aren't any
lines already.{?_39}{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 30:
The smallest possible territory is one
triangle, but try to capture many at once.{?_39}{PAUSE}{WIPE}
If your opponent has lines inside your
territory, they will change to your color.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 31:
But if your opponent has some territory
within the area you captured, it remains
his color.{?_39}{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 32:
You can build off of the lines surrounding
your territory to capture new spaces.{?_39}{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 33:
When there aren't any more spaces to
place lines, the game is over.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
The person with the most triangles in
their territory will be the
winner.{?_39}{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 34:
Oh, I forgot. Both players have a time
limit, so you can't spend too much time
thinking about your moves.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But you'll always have at least
a few seconds to make a move.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 35:
Those are the game rules.
Do you want me to explain them again?{CHOICE Y/N DEF1}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 36:
I'm sorry, but your time is up.
I win this time.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's good to be careful about your moves,
but if you take too long, this can happen.
Next game, pay more attention to the time.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 37:
Too bad.
I win this time.
Hmm. Maybe I tried a little too hard?{PAUSE}{WIPE}
No, just kidding.
I hope you'll come and play me
again.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 38:
Hmm. That was a close one.
I win this time.
I'll be waiting for a rematch.{PAUSE}{EOM}

I lose!
Ho ho ho.{PAUSE}{WIPE}

I'd be happy to play you again,
Young un'.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 40:
Darn!
I lose!
You're pretty good, young un'.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But things will be different next time.
I'll want a rematch against you
sometime, so please play me again.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 41:
Ho ho ho.
This time it's a tie.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
You're pretty good, youngin'.
Let's play again sometime.{PAUSE}{EOM}
