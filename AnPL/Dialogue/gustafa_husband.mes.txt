It's great to plant seeds and harvest

If that's a hybrid seed, it might turn

That hoe contains the soul of the

I guess the more you use a tool, the
more it shapes itself to your hand...
Musical instruments are the same way.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Is there something wrong with it?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Doesn't seem to be any problem with it...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

you can use it to water lots of crops?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Going to do some watering?{PAUSE}{EOM}

A big watering can is best. You don't

What about it?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 258:
You use that to milk the cows,
right?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 259:
I like doing it by hand better.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

That looks like it would hurt if

You use that to shear sheep, right?
Don't try to use it on me.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Did you find that yourself?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

I think that's about the highest

Are you on a stroll too?
The trees sure are pretty.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

When I walk around looking at the scenery,
I find that all kinds of melodies just

Message 352:
They used to call spring the “Verdant
Season” because everything's green.
Isn't that nice?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 353:
Maybe I'll go play my guitar somewhere...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 354:
Forget-Me-Not Valley has nice scenery,

Have you seen that big red star?
You can only see it at this time of the
year. It should be over the ocean.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 358:
I heard that the people in this area
used to call Summer the “Pepper Season.”
I guess it's because its so hot...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 359:
The best place for playing the guitar
is in the shade of a tree. Sometimes some
other guy's there before me though...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 360:
Do you ever write poetry?
This is the perfect time of year for that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 361:
When I come up with a good poem, I always
feel like singing it. And the melody just
comes naturally... For example...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
♪The sunlight gently breaks through
the trees, and dapples your sleeping
face...♪{PAUSE}{WIPE}
You know?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 362:
I heard that the people in this area used
to call fall the “Umber Season.” It's
because the leaves turn red and brown.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 363:
Have you seen that pretty yellow star? You
can only see it at this time of the year.
It should be over the eastern mountains.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 364:
When the air is so cold and clear, it
seems like my guitar sounds better.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 365:
Sounds seem to be a lot clearer this
time of year, so I find myself thinking of
all kinds of new melodies.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
For example...

You know?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 366:
I heard that the people in this area

I guess blue is a cold color, huh?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 367:
The stars at night are so pretty this time
of year. Especially the blue one that
appears over the waterfall.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 368:
There'd be nothing better than playing my
guitar while looking up at the stars...
But it's a little cold right now...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 369:
I cook occasionally, but it can't
compare to your cooking,
{NICKNAME}.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 370:
When you're busy, I can just make
something for myself if you'll put
some food in the fridge.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 371:
What kind of food does {TATSUYA}
like? I like strong, spicy food
myself...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 372:
Cooking is a real art form.
You put together all kinds of ingredients
to form a single masterpiece.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 373:
Kid's rooms are pretty interesting.
There's all kinds of stuff in them...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 374:
I wonder what {TATSUYA} wants
to be in the future...
I'm looking forward to it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 375:
I wonder what {TATSUYA}
really thinks about me...
Probably that I'm a weird old man...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 376:
It's funny how kids can get attached
to the strangest things. I know I used to
collect all sorts of stuff...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 377:
{TATSUYA} seems to be reading some
pretty difficult books...
I guess our kid's all grown up.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 378:
I'd like to show {TATSUYA} all
kinds of things. I'm sure one of them
will spark an interest.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 379:
I guess we can't go into the kid's room
without knocking anymore.
They sure grow up fast, don't they?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 380:
I like to come here sometimes and play
with my instruments.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 381:
This may just be a small tent, but
to me the world inside it is bigger
than everything outside.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 382:
When I'm surrounded by musical
instruments, if I listen very closely,
it's like they're playing by themselves...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 383:
A long time ago, I visited some nomads.
They taught me how to make this kind of
tent, so I made one for myself.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 384:
Zzzz... Zzzz...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 385:

I'd rather we were like two good
friends...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 387:
I wonder if {TATSUYA} likes music?
I'd love to play with my kid someday.
Maybe it's just a selfish dream...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 388:
I don't watch much television, but
when I turned it on the other day,
somebody was playing the tabla!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

I'd like to help you with the farm work,
but I think I'd just get in the way.
I can help clean sometimes, though...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 392:
It feels good to touch the earth...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 393:
It seems like the closer you get to the
forest, the more fertile the soil is.
Isn't that the case with that field there?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 394:
Watching crops develop really makes you
aware of the passage of time. It never
really changes. It just keeps marching on.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 395:
I like flowers. Some of our crops
have some very pretty ones, you know?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 396:
Looking at the grass is pretty relaxing.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 397:
The grass grows well around here.
I bet we could let the animals graze here
all the time.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 398:
Thanks.
But I think I'd better
pass for now.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 399:
It's raining...
I love getting wet in the rain.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 400:
If it's raining, just let yourself get
soaked. If you don't like getting wet,
just wait for it to stop before going out.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 401:
You don't have to water the crops on
days like this, huh?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 402:
You don't mind getting wet?
It feels good, doesn't it?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 403:
I thought I might clean the barn
once in a while...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 404:
It's not really working, but I thought if
there was something I could do to
contribute, I should do it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 405:
Working on a farm isn't easy, is it?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 406:
The air is so clean and fresh here.
The smells of trees and water really
help relax the human body.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 407:
The forest is always kind of dark, even
at noon. It's kind of exciting...
Like something could jump out at you...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 408:
A long time ago, there was a Harvest
Goddess living here.
I wonder if she still is...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 409:
Do you come here often too?
I like it here.
...It's so relaxing.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 410:
What did you think of that song?
{CHOICE3 DEF1}
It's a good song.

You're a good guitar player.{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

{FACE_140003}You think so? Thanks.
That's one of my favorites.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

in music.
Maybe I'll try some different songs later.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 413:
{FACE_140003}Hahaha... I'm just strumming a bit.
But it's nice of you to say so.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 414:
Would you like to sing a song with me?
Don't worry about the words. Just sing
along with the melody.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 415:
When I'm playing the guitar, it'd
be nice if you could sing along with
the songs...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}
