Welcome to the Music Room.
How is everyone today?
This is our special New Year's edition,{PAUSE}
featuring the musician McCoy.
When most people think of McCoy, they
probably think of his song “Mistake”.{PAUSE}
In fact, “Mistake” was originally
written as an instrumental piece.
McCoy isn't only a composer--he's also{PAUSE}
a virtuoso at the mysterious instrument
known as the “ogritch”.
“Mistake” was written to be performed{PAUSE}
on the ogritch, as it happens.
The song's deep and purposeful segments
are what make it so difficult to sing.{PAUSE}
It took a lot of training to develop a
voice like that, but the song stands on
its own as an instrumental, too.{PAUSE}
And on that note--no pun intended--let's
listen to the instrumental version of
“Mistake” as we end our show today.{PAUSE}
