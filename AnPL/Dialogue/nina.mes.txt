Excuse me, {PETE}?{PAUSE}{EOM}

I like this {VAR_00}.
How much?

For you, {GOLD_0105}G.
It's {GOLD_0205}G.
I can't sell that.{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

{FACE_120009}Well, ah...
I'm sorry, but I don't much
like those, you see...{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 37:
I liked them when I was younger, but
as you get older, your tastes change.
Sorry.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 38:
I'm not really
interested in that.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 39:
I'm afraid I still don't like them.
Sorry about that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 40:
Oh, my! How cute!
Animals certainly are relaxing.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 41:
{S_340161}What a little darling!
Maybe we ought to get a pet
for ourselves.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 42:
{S_340161}And what kind of seed is that?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 43:
I don't know what kind of seed it is,
but I know you'll grow it well.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 44:
Did you grow that on your farm?
It looks so fresh and tasty...
You can always share them with me.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 45:
My, does that look delicious.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 46:
From your farm, right?
It looks nice and fresh.
It must be very good milk.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 47:
Old and new bones need milk's calcium.
We must not forget that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 48:

How delectable!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 50:
Ah, a hoe?
Well, now, I wouldn't know
the first thing about that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 51:
Are you off to tend your fields now?
Don't work too hard.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 52:
It must get easier to use the
more practice you get with it.
But not for an old woman like me.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 53:
Ah, a sickle?
Well, now, I wouldn't know
much at all about that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 54:
This may be common sense,
but you're better off not swinging
that thing around here.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 55:
That reminds me of my
husband's watering can.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 56:
Do you use that watering
can on bonsai, too?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 57:
What on earth is that?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 58:
Ah, so that's a milking machine?
That must be how you get such
delicious milk.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 59:
Those are... clippers, right?
You be careful with those.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 60:
Do you shear sheep with those?
Just be careful, all right?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 61:
And what is this?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 62:
Tools get easier to handle
the more you use them.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 63:
I may be an old woman now,
but I still love jewels.
What kind of stone is that?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 64:
What a mysterious stone.
I bet it's a very expensive
and fancy jewel in the rough.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 65:
{S_340160}Oh, my!
Why, how wonderful!{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 66:
And where did you find that?
I'm so excited.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 67:
And what kind of plant is that?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 68:
I don't quite understand the details.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 69:
What could that be?
Some kind of giant cookie?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 70:
What are you going to do with
a giant cookie, anyway?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 71:
What could that be?
Some kind of seasoning?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 72:
Are you going to use that to
cook something delicious for me?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 73:
{S_3400DA}{S_3205DC}What a strange sound.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 74:
{S_3400DA}{S_3205DC}It's quite an interesting sound--
where on earth did you find that?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 75:
Is that some sort of medal?
Wait... where have I seen that before?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 76:
I certainly don't know anything
about any medals.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 77:
Ah, a necklace!
I'm afraid it's not my style, though.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 78:
It might suit me nicely if
I were a little younger.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 79:
What book do you have there?
It's simply full of symbols...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 80:
Aha, is that used in music? What do they
call it...? Sheet music?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 81:
Say, is that some sort of bomb?!
A-are you crazy?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 82:
Fireworks, you say?
Now, that's quite enough.
You'll give me a heart attack!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 83:
Eh? Are you giving it to me?
Oh, no, that's all right!
It's the thought that counts.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 84:
{S_340160}Eh?
Is that a present for someone?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

We used to live in the city. We
came to Forget-Me-Not Valley in our
old age for a more leisurely life.{PAUSE}{EOM}

well, it's not really my favorite.
I'm sorry about that.{PAUSE}{EOM}
