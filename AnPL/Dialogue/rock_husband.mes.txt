I love cheese.
Especially if it's good cheese.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 241:
It's the milk that makes good cheese good.
So we've got to raise cows that give
good milk. Right?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 242:
Cheese sells for more than milk, so it's
better to concentrate on that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I like butter.
But it's gotta be good butter,
or forget it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

You can use butter in cooking.{PAUSE}
And it sells for more than milk,
too.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Do you think that egg would hatch if you

I don't think I'm cut out for any kind of
work where you have to use that.
{FACE_1A0009}But I guess you knew that, huh?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 263:
Something special about that?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

You use that to milk the cows, right?
Good luck.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

You use those to shear the sheep, right?
Don't try and use them on me.{PAUSE}{EOM}

No, of course not.{PAUSE}{EOM}

You like clippers?
Are you some kind of clipper freak?

make into a pendant.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Oh... Well you'd better not
give it to anybody else.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 272:
That's a handsome rock... “Handsome rock?”
I like the sound of that for some reason.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

If it's a rare stone, maybe you could
sell it and make a lot of money.{PAUSE}{EOM}

It's kind of interesting.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Give it to him.
Don't give it to him.

I wonder what I should do with it...
Maybe I'll sell it to Van.{PAUSE}{WIPE}

shopping. And don't forget soap operas.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 337:
Living here, I feel like time
sort of passes really slowly.
You know what I mean?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 338:
Farm life is pretty fun.
Well, I guess that's because you're
working for the both of us.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 339:
I saw Takakura's notebook on the bookshelf
the other day. Takakura's a real pro
at farming, huh?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 340:
I'm not just sitting around watching
TV all day. I read books and
listen to music sometimes, too.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 341:
I like this room pretty well.
It's simple and quiet. A perfect room
for taking a nice rest.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 342:
If you ask me, this is the time
when we should be reading everything
about farming. Right?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 343:
If you ask me, this is the time
when we should be enjoying farm life
as much as we can. Understand?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 344:
I'd like to stay with you on the
farm forever.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 345:
I just stopped by for a visit.
Do you have some business here, too?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 346:
I'll be going home soon.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 347:
I sometimes get the urge to talk to other
people, so I like to stop by lots of
places and chat.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 348:
This is a perfect day for just wandering
around and doing nothing.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 349:
{FACE_1A0003}I feel like going partying!
{FACE_1A0009}Er, after my work is done,
of course.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 350:
I love this time of year. I'd like to take
{TATSUYA} to look at the flowers.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 351:
You seem to be running all the time.
Don't you get tired?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 352:
Oh, where are you off to?
{CHOICE3 DEF1}
Just down the way...
Oh, nowhere...
None of your business.{EOM}

Message 353:
{FACE_1A0002}That's kind of vague...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 354:
{FACE_1A0002}You're just wandering around?{PAUSE}{WIPE}
{FACE_1A0003}Just like me, then.
Ha ha ha!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 355:
{FACE_1A0007}Woah, that's kind of cold.
And what's that supposed to mean, anyway?{PAUSE}{WIPE}
{FACE_1A0000}Well, never mind.
I won't let under my skin.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 356:
The beach is the best place at this time
of year. I may not look it, but I'm
a quite a surfer.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Seriously. Even now when
I see a killer wave, I get all
excited.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 357:
Everybody says it's so hot at this
time of year, but I'm fine.
I can't stand the cold, though.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 358:
When I'm taking a walk like this, I
always start to feel romantic.
I guess it's that kind of season, huh?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 359:
By the way, Mom was saying that you
can collect all kinds of tasty wild
plants at this time of year.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 360:
Have you seen that weird guy sitting
underneath the tree?
I wonder what his story is...?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 361:
Some tasty mushrooms grow near
Vesta's farm, you know.
I wish I had some Mushroom Gratin.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 362:
I suppose Wally and his kid are out
jogging, even in this cold.
I can't believe it{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 363:
{FACE_1A0002}Well anyway,
try not to catch cold.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 364:
I can't believe that guy sitting under
the tree doesn't catch cold like that.
Man.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 365:
At this time of year there's always a
white abominable snowman-lookin' guy in
the forest. I like him though.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 366:
When there's nothing in the fridge I feel
kinda depressed, so try and keep it
stocked, OK?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 367:
Sometimes I feel like cooking myself.
What do you think?
{CHOICE3 DEF1}
Why not?
Maybe not...
You're gonna hurt yourself.{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 368:
Yeah... But I guess I'll forget about
it for now. I don't want to show you
up or anything...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 369:
If you say so.
I'll just forget about it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 370:
{FACE_1A0002}Very funny...
Maybe I'll just go ahead and cook
when you're not looking.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 371:
If I cooked something, would you eat it?{CHOICE Y/N DEF0}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 372:
Really?
Thanks. Just hearing you say that
is enough for me.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 373:
{FACE_1A0002}Oh...
Then I'll just make it for me
and {TATSUYA}...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 374:
I'm kind of a gourmet, so I'm
a little picky about food.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But the food you make is always
great, {NICKNAME}.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 375:
Just remember this:
I can't stand Tempura.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 376:
I wonder what {TATSUYA} wants
to be in the future.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 377:
We should probably avoid going
into {TATSUYA}'s room for
a while.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But it's just a phase.
I'm sure of it.
I remember being like that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 378:
Even though it's all part of the same
house, I feel a little nervous
going into {TATSUYA}'s room.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 379:
Have you seen {TATSUYA}'s diary?
I found it on the bookshelf the other
day and had a little peek.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's pretty interesting.
But don't let {TATSUYA} catch you.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 380:
When you look at a kid's room, you can
tell what they're interested in.
Are you cleaning up here, {NICKNAME}?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 381:
When I'm in {TATSUYA}'s room,
I remember back when I was a kid.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 382:
When I'm in this room,
I remember back when I was a kid.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 383:
Any good reads around here?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 384:
Hey, I read more than just
comic books, you know.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 385:
Zzzz... Zzz...{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 386:
Yaaawn...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 387:
I'm kind of sick of TV.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 388:
I suppose I don't have any right to say
this, but is the farm making any money?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 389:
Working in the fields is pretty tough.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 390:
I kind of like playing in the dirt,
but I don't think I'm cut out
for raising crops and stuff...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 391:
When I look out over the fields here,
I feel kinda like I'm working.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 392:
I love seeing the grass roll like
that in the wind...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 393:
When I'm checking the growth of the grass
like this, I feel kinda like I'm working.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

But I guess I should pass for now.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 405:
Where are you going in this weather?
Of course I'm out walking in
the rain, too, but...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 406:
You don't think our roof leaks, do you?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 407:
There's so much to see and do
on a farm. It's a lot of fun.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 408:
Takakura can buy whatever we need
for the farm when he goes to the
city, huh?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 409:
I thought maybe I could help
you with something.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 410:
I like animals, but I don't really
like taking care of them...
Is that bad?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 411:
Hey, would you like to have a
turtle on the farm? I saw a really
big one in the swamp...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 412:
I went to visit Mom and Dad.
They seem to be doing fine.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 413:
Oh yeah!
We've got to have a milk
drinking contest.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Come on, {NICKNAME}.
What do you say?{CHOICE Y/N DEF0}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 414:
All right. Let's go!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 415:
Oh...
Well, maybe next time.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 416:
Whenever I come here, I remember
