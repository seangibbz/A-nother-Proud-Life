I was just telling Tim about the results
of the diet that Romana told me about last
month.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 197:
Now I was a little skeptical
about the diet at first...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
After all, you're supposed to put on a
blindfold and walk around flapping your
arms about twice a day...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
So I did that for 10 days and then
I stepped onto my new
bathroom scale...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 198:
And would you believe it!{PAUSE}{WIPE}
{FACE_240000}The scale read 80 pounds!
{FACE_24000A}I guess all of my hard work was worth it!
Ha, ha, ha!{S_3202BC}

Message 208:
Given my failure with the last diet,
I was a little skeptical at first.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
After all, you're supposed to put on a

your arms sticking out twice a day.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But apparently modern science has

{FACE_240000}My weight had gone down to 199 pounds!

this time...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 212:
I'll admit that my previous two failures
have made me wary of diets...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
And it's true that this diet consists of
ramming your body against a thick piece of
wood 15 times, twice a day.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
So I did that for 10 days and then

Message 214:
I've had so many failures in the past,
that I was unsure about this diet.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
After all, it consists of climbing up on
Daryl's roof and touching that sparky
thing twice a day.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
So I did that for 10 days and then

Wasn't the scale just in kilograms...?

Message 216:
What with all of my failures in the past,
I was certainly skeptical about it.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
After all, I was supposed to go to the
beach twice a day and scream at the sun
21 times while rolling in the sand...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most

{FACE_240000}My weight was down to 76 pounds!

{FACE_240000}My weight had gone down to 60 inches!

I've had failure after failure, so you can

I'd lose weight, so I've taken up running.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
