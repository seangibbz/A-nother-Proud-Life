In part 5 of our expedition series,
we went to a forgotten island in
search of the elusive water monkey.{PAUSE}
••••••••••••••••••••
Komri Island, in the middle of the
Sargasso's Shikra Sea, appears on no map.{PAUSE}
The say the world's only water monkeys
live here, at Lake Yanyan.{PAUSE}
We ventured into the heart of Komri Island
in search of this strange creature.{PAUSE}
At a glance, this island, surrounded
by lava, appears to be lifeless.{PAUSE}
Where is this Lake Yanyan? First we
set out to find this body of water.{PAUSE}
Lake Yanyan was discovered 100 years
ago by the explorer Josef Necht, and is
known only from an entry in his diary.{PAUSE}
Here it is:{PAUSE}

..........................................
We waited for nightfall.
Just as the moon reached its peak in
the sky, we heard a faint noise.{PAUSE}
“Yanyan...yanyan...” It did sound
like “yanyan”, after all.{PAUSE}
We moved toward the noise, guided by
moonlight. There were cracks in the
hardened lava here and there.{PAUSE}
That's where the sound was coming from.
Suddenly there came a “yanyan!”
from close by.{PAUSE}
We found a fairly large crevice
and went inside.{PAUSE}
A narrow cave led even deeper in.
The moonlight through the crevice
sent a beam into the darkness ahead.{PAUSE}
After walking a while, the cave
suddenly opened up before us.
The next instant took our breath away.{PAUSE}

Last time, our intrepid exploration team
came across something deep in a cave
on Komri Island. What could it be?{PAUSE}
..........................................
An unbelievable scene unfolded before
us at the end of the narrow tunnel.{PAUSE}
It was a domed chamber that must
have been more than 150 feet high.{PAUSE}
There was a hole in the domed ceiling,
and the moon reflected off the surface
of the lake we saw before us.{PAUSE}
We had found Lake Yanyan.
It was too dark to see its edges, but
the dark shapes rippling on its surface{PAUSE}
were probably the shadows of trees.
We were captivated by this magnificent
scene, but before long the “yanyan” sound{PAUSE}
brought us to our senses again.
This time it was much louder,
echoing in the domed chamber.{PAUSE}
Everyone was certain beyond all doubt
that this was the cry of the water monkey.
But where could they be?{PAUSE}
In the water?
...We wouldn't be able to hear them.{PAUSE}
On closer inspection, the trees'
shadows appeared to be moving.
We stared at them intently.{PAUSE}
