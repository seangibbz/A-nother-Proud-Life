Message 2:
You saw that, did you?
How embarrassing.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's was so long ago.
We took that picture when we went
to a country far to the south.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
We were so young, then...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 3:
Oh, that's right.
We got this from somebody on
our trip.{PAUSE}{WIPE}

OK then. If you see {NAMI}, tell
her that we went looking for her. She just
left her rent behind and disappeared.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

{NAMI} just left her rent money behind

Um... {NAMI}...
About that money you left in your room...
It was the exact amount of your rent so...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Well, that's a relief.
Come on, Ruby. Cook something up for her.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 15:
Oh, {NAMI}...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
There was a telephone call from your
father last night. I told him how much

I'm sorry for coming so early like this.
But I have something to ask you...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 24:
The truth is that {NAMI} is planning
on leaving today.
What do you think of that, {PETE}?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 25:
{PETE}, I heard that you
proposed to {NAMI}.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But {NAMI} said that she regrets
turning you down.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
So if you still feel the same way,
I thought...
{CHOICE2 DEF0}
Propose to her.
Don't marry anyone.{EOM}{EOM}

Why, that's a Blue Feather.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

You're not going to marry anyone?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

The truth is that {NAMI} is planning

Message 32:
{NAMI}...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 33:
Of course we want {NAMI} to
stay at our inn.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But I'm afraid we just can't afford
to keep a non-paying customer. But
I thought maybe you might be able to help.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Luckily, {NAMI} seems to like you,
and you like her.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Er, I thought you did...

Live together.
Stay single forever.{EOM}

Great! Isn't that wonderful, {NAMI}?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 36:
What?
Single... forever? I see...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 37:
{PETE}, I heard that you
proposed to {NAMI}.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
{NAMI} said that she regrets
turning you down.
That's why I brought her here.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 38:
What can I do for you today?
{CHOICE2 DEF0}
I came to see {NAMI}.
I came to talk with you.{EOM}{EOM}

Message 39:
Oh really!
Thank you very much.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
{NAMI} hasn't been very cheerful
recently, so we've been worried about her.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Oh dear, she's not here.

Please try and cheer her up!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 43:
Oh? You want to talk to me?
Well, that's nice of you.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
To tell you the truth, I am a little
worried about how {NAMI}'s been
acting recently. She seems so depressed.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 44:
{NAMI} sure was
acting strange!{PAUSE}{WIPE}
{PETE}, I'm sorry but do you
think you could try and cheer
{NAMI} up for me?{PAUSE}{EOM}

{FACE_180000}Come on inside.
Your room is just as you left it.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
{FACE_180003}I think I've told you before, but we

Oh, {PETE}.
You have very good timing...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 53:
{NAMI} left her rent money behind
and just disappeared.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Do you think she might have left
us for good?{PAUSE}{WIPE}
I'm sorry, but if you see {NAMI},
could you tell her we're looking for her?
{CHOICE2 DEF0}
I understand.
I'll go look for her.{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I know it's early, but...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 55:
R-really?!
Well that's just... Thank you!!{PAUSE}{EOM}

It makes me feel better to hear
you say that. Well then, could you go and
check the places {NAMI} might go?{PAUSE}{WIPE}
We'll split up and look ourselves.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 57:
{PETE}...
What is it?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 58:
You couldn't find her, huh?
Do you think she might already have left?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

You went too soon.{S_3207D0}{PAUSE}
Leave {TATSUYA} to us

{PETE}, do you have a minute?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 69:
{FACE_180007}Oh, that's too bad. I guess you just
sold out of everything.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I guess I'd better come back some other
time.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Oh, I was just hoping you might have some
good ingredients we could use for cooking.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Don't mind me.
I'm just looking.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Hmm...
You don't seem to have ingredients that
would be good for serving at the inn.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Is this all you have?
Hmm....{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

No, I guess not.
Sorry.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I'm sorry.
Please don't give it another thought.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

That's one of my favorites.
I've traveled the world and sampled many

That looks very good.
No, really.
I can hear my stomach growling.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 95:
You've got to stay at our inn sometime.
My wife will cook something nice for you.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

It's the ingredients that make or break
the dish, so I choose them very carefully.{PAUSE}{EOM}

No, I know about these things.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Looks a lot like you.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

What a well behaved child.
Looks a lot like you.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Well behaved children must be easy to
raise. Our Rock was quite a handful
even when he was very young...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

{FACE_180003}Well hello there.
That looks like a very intelligent
dog to me.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

{FACE_180007}...Um.
To tell you the truth, I don't like dogs.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Hm? Well, that is...
I guess I should say that I'm kind
of scared of them.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

{FACE_180007}I know I shouldn't be afraid of
dogs, as big as I am.
I'm so embarrassed...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

How nice. I feel relaxed just looking

Why, it looks just delic-- I mean, its
looks like it would lay nice eggs.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

What a delic-- I mean handsome

You know, there's a place where
they eat big fat ducks flame
broiled.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But when I actually went there,
it was too expensive for me to eat.
It sure looked good though.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Oh, we grow some food of our own, so
I know about these things.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I hope it grows well. I'm sure we could
use it at the inn when you harvest it.

I looks good... I guess.
Can those be used in cooking?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}
