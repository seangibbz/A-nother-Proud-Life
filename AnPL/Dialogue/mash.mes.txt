Message 209:
Hybridization is when you take the genes of
two plants and make a third, new plant.
It can be pretty interesting.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
For example, if you combined a Tomato and
a Watermelon, you'd get a {CROP_0005}
that has both of their genes.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Or if you combined a Melon and a
Strawberry, you'd get a {CROP_000A}
that has both of their genes.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
And if you combine the {CROP_0005} and the
{CROP_000A}, you get something that has
genes from all of those plants.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}
