Today, I went out to sea for a big catch.{PAUSE}
As I guided my small boat over the waves,
I could only hear the sounds of the water
and the seagulls.{PAUSE}
I watched the movements of the birds and
then threw my bait into the water.
I moved the bait from inside the boat.{PAUSE}
All that was left was to wait.
........The sun was so hot...
I concentrated on the rod in my hands.{PAUSE}
I could feel the fish's movements through
the line...
Now!!{PAUSE}
At the end of the taut line was
my prey.
...A fair sized tuna.{PAUSE}
As soon as I pull it up onto the boat
I prepared it to be used for bait for an
even bigger fish, and threw it overboard.{PAUSE}
The real fight was yet to come.

My live tuna bait was moving actively.{PAUSE}
It was only a matter of time before a big
one struck. I concentrated on the rod in
my hands, feeling the tension in the line.{PAUSE}
But I didn't feel anything but the bait.
The birds had disappeared earlier, and the
setting sun reflected on the calm sea.{PAUSE}
I began to feel sleepy. The sun had nearly
set. I should be heading home...........!
Just then, the line moved.{PAUSE}
And the hand holding the rod started to
be pulled into the ocean! Oh no!

It was a strong tug, the first in ages.{PAUSE}
But this fellow was different.
I held fast onto the line as off
he swam, pulling the boat with him.{PAUSE}
Some time later, I realized the boat
was floating quietly in the moonlight.
It had stopped moving.{PAUSE}
I pulled in the line with numb
fingers. My prize was drawing
nearer, heavy as a boulder.{PAUSE}
The sky and sea turned orange as a
fishy shape rose up through the water.
My finned foe sparkled in the sunrise.{PAUSE}
Its form grew larger and larger.
Eventually it was bigger than the boat.
...I couldn't pull it in.{PAUSE}
I ended up tying it to the boat.
The swordfish weighed over 1000 pounds!
Hard to pull up, a pain to get back home.{PAUSE}
How far could he have dragged me...?

Looking around, I didn't see the shore.{PAUSE}
I'd have to use my intuition to steer.
...? The boat is moving by itself.
But how? There's no wind!{PAUSE}
...?!
The swordfish was waving its tail.
It was still alive!{PAUSE}
If he moved the boat, I could steer it.
I set out for land and grabbed the wheel.
...At last I spotted familiar scenery.{PAUSE}
It was night when we reached the shore.
The swordfish had exhausted his strength.{PAUSE}
I sat for a while and stared at this
magnificent catch...{EOM}{EOM}

Today we'll be talking about trout.
This season is the best for trout fishing,
when the sun heats up the river.{PAUSE}
Trout is at its tastiest right now.
Find a fast-flowing river with hard
sand. Face the sun as you let your{PAUSE}
baited hook dip into the water.
You should get a bite right away.
If not, better find another spot.{PAUSE}
...Got one!
A fighter, too. Tire it out, then reel
it in and scoop it into your net.{PAUSE}
It's a fair-sized rainbow trout.
It looks like more than enough for
a delicious trout dinner tonight.{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Today we'll talk about carp fishing.{PAUSE}
You need patience to catch carp!
When you find a carp lake, come by the
same spot every day to toss in bait.{PAUSE}
Start fishing when the carp begin
gathering at that spot. You might catch
some in the early morning or at night.{PAUSE}
After tossing in your bait, just wait.
And wait...and wait. It might take
2 or 3 days until you get a bite.{PAUSE}
If you're lucky, you'll catch a whopper.
...And that's carp fishing.{EOM}

Today we're out salmon fishing.{PAUSE}
Salmon swim upstream in the summer.
Aim for the very bottom of the middle
of a wide rushing river.{PAUSE}
Fish eggs are good for bait.
You should get a bite after a while.
Now, timing is everything with salmon.{PAUSE}
He'll tug hard, then try to take off.
Be prepared for a fight!
Reel in your line to bring in your prize.{PAUSE}
Finally, use the last of your strength
to draw that silver fish out of the water.
That's a fantastic king salmon.{PAUSE}
If all goes well, you'll be having
salmon steaks on your dinner table.{EOM}{EOM}
