Well, if you don't have anything to sell,

That looks delicious.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Is that milk from {FARM} Farm?
I'll bet it's very fresh.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

That milk looks quite fresh.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Did you make that cheese?
{FARM} Farm's original cheese?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I guess there are lots of kinds of cheese.
I don't really know anything about that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

He's quite a cook.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Did you make that butter yourself?
Is it called “{FARM} Butter”?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 67:
I've been trying to cut down on
fatty foods recently.
At least Sebastian says I should.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Dishes cooked with butter are delicious.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

All right, please give it to
Sebastian.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Did one of your chickens lay that egg?

Well, well. I didn't know you could
catch fish like that around here.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Is that an edible fish?
But raw? No thanks.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

{S_34013A}My, did you find that around here?
Is it edible?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I'll take it then.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

{FACE_080002}Oh, I see.
Well, why don't you eat it yourself
then?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

What are you doing with that hoe?
There's no point in trying to till
the soil around here.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Off to work in the fields?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Please don't wave that thing around
here.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Well, that sickle's still somewhat new.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

You shouldn't wander around with that.{PAUSE}{EOM}

You've used that sickle quite a lot.
Take good care of it.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 87:
What do you think of that watering can?
Do you like it?{CHOICE Y/N DEF0}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 88:
{FACE_08000A}That's good.
I knew that you'd like it.
Yes sir.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 89:
{FACE_080009}{S_340139}Hmm. It is a strange shape, I'll admit.
But if you'd use it, I'm sure you'll get
to like it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 90:
That's the watering can I gave you.
It may be strangely shaped, but I
think you'll find it easy to use.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

That's the watering can I gave you.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 92:
Use it well.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 93:
Oh, did you get a new watering can?
It looks like you haven't used it much.
Don't forget to water your plants.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 94:
When you've used a watering can for a
long time, it becomes like a part of you.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 95:
I may not look it, but people called me a
master of watering in my day.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 96:
There's no point in using that here.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 97:
Goodness, what an old watering can.
But I bet it's very easy to use.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 98:
That watering can has been used a lot.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 99:
When I was a little girl, I had to milk
the cows by hand. Things certainly
are more convenient nowadays.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 100:
There aren't any cows around here.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 101:
Do you use that to shear your sheep?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 102:
Maybe you should use that to cut
Cody's hair. {S_34013B}Heh heh.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 103:
Those must make shearing sheep easier.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 104:
You've certainly used those clippers for a
long time. They must be well made.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 105:
{S_340139}Don't you have anything more
interesting to show me?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Where are you going with that?{PAUSE}{EOM}

My, what an unusual stone.
That might be rather valuable.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Is that stone for me?{CHOICE Y/N DEF0}{EOM}

{FACE_08000A}Thank you.

Message 110:
{S_340139}{FACE_080002}Oh... Hmph...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 111:
That's kind of dusty for an antique.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 112:
Did you find that around here?
Sebastian often takes strolls, so maybe
he'd know more about that than me.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 113:
I wonder if that's edible.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 114:
{S_34013A}My, isn't that a record?
How unusual.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 115:
What kind of record is it?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 116:
I used to listen to records a lot.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 117:
Is that some kind of spice?
My, I bet you could make some very
tasty dishes with that.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 118:
{S_340139}I wonder what it tastes like.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 119:

Was it that drum?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

{S_3400DA}{S_3205DC}{FACE_08000C}What an odd drum.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 121:
I guess Wally won that in some kind
of race.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Doesn't Wally want that anymore?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 123:
What an odd necklace. I bet there's
an interesting history behind it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

It's not really my taste, though.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 125:
Isn't that Lumina's
sheet music?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Did Lumina give it to you?
Since she can't play herself
she gave it to you, right?{PAUSE}{EOM}

I cannot play.{PAUSE}{EOM}

I bet that firecracker would be pretty

{FACE_08000A}That milk you gave me
was just fantastic.
It was really very good.{PAUSE}{EOM}

That milk you gave me
tasted pretty good, but it might
be even better made into cheese.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 145:
That milk you gave me
tasted just fantastic. You simply
have to try making cheese with it.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 146:
That milk you gave me was rich and
very delicious.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 147:
That milk you gave me tasted pretty
good, but I think it would be even
better made into butter.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

That milk you gave me tasted
just wonderful. But it might be
a little rich for me.{PAUSE}{EOM}

one of my favorite foods.
You made that, didn't you?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 154:
Did you make that dish you gave me?
You're not quite as good as

But I can tell you're doing your best.
One look at your arms tells me that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 163:
Do you often cook at home?
I've heard that you're a very good cook.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

I guess you've gotten used to working

You seem somehow more relaxed.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

You've gotten used to growing crops,
I guess?{PAUSE}
That's good.{EOM}

Message 166:
I've heard that you're quite a
good cook.
I'd love to taste your cooking.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 167:
This area has changed a great deal.
Why, when Sebastian and I came here, there
weren't any other houses here at all.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But soon the farm across the river came,
and then Wally and his family.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
And those... strange ones.
You know -- Kassey, Patrick and Cody.
They came around the same time.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Then the inn and the bar were built.
It's pretty active around here nowadays.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 168:
Speaking of which, your farm has actually
been here for quite a long time.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But its owner went off somewhere and left
it empty for a long time.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 169:
Lumina was so small when she came to
live here, but she's grown so big now.

I sometimes get a little lonely,
living in this big old house.

visit us.
But I guess you're quite busy.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Doesn't Lumina sound a bit better?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 195:
Isn't that a nice song?
I love that one.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 196:
Maybe I should start charging admission...
{FACE_08001A}Heheheh...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 197:
Oh dear, to think that I have to subject
myself to the services of this quack
doctor. Getting old is no fun.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 198:
I keep telling him that there's
nothing wrong with me.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 199:
Getting old is not for the faint of heart.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 200:
I've never liked doctors.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 201:
Did I ever tell you?
I'm having a little contest with that
quack.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Hm? What kind of contest?
Isn't it obvious? We're seeing who's
going to kick the bucket first!{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 202:
I forget to mention it, but in my contest
with that quack, the one who dies first
is the loser. And I hate losing.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 203:
I don't mind dying, but I'll be darned if
I'm going to let that quack beat me.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 204:
I always play to win, you know.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 205:
You remember the contest I told you about?
I bet I'll live longer than Dr Hardy.
A doctor can't operate on himself.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 206:
I've been saddled with that quack since
before I moved here. I keep telling him
I'm fine, but he insists on examining me.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 207:
That Dr Hardy has guts, I'll give him
that. Imagine, competing with me.
I never lose, you know.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 208:
Dr. Hardy is more stubborn than I thought.
Well, two can play at this game.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 209:
Come to think of it, you've
gotten older too, haven't you?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 210:
{FACE_080019}I'm busy snacking at the moment.
Please be quiet.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 211:
{FACE_080019}I told you not to talk to me.
If Sebastian hears you, he'll catch
me snacking.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 212:
{FACE_080002}I said be quiet.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 213:
Kate is interviewing me at the moment. She
said she's going to write a book about me.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 214:
I wonder what kind of book it'll be.
I think I'd make a great tragic heroine.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 215:
Be sure to read the book when it
gets published.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 216:
{S_34013B}I'm looking forward to it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 217:
Kate is interviewing me at the moment. She
said she's going to write a book about me.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 218:
It seems to be taking a very long time.
It must be a quite a book she's writing.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 219:
I hope she finishes it while I'm
still alive.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 220:
Oh, I see.
But I really shouldn't now...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 221:
This weather isn't good for walking.
This is a sun umbrella, you know.
A parasol.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

It can be slippery around here.
Watch your step.{PAUSE}

Message 224:
Well done. You can play the music
just as it's written on the page.
But try to be a little more creative, too.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 225:
I suppose you think there's no point in an
old lady like me having nice things, eh?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 226:
Oh, I'm just joking.{PAUSE}
....{S_3201F4}
Go ahead and look.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 227:
No, that's not for sale.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 228:
I wouldn't think so.
It's one of a kind.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 229:
I guess you could say that.
She was very fond of Ronet.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 230:
Anyway, it's not for sale.
Why don't you move along?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 231:
There's no point if it's not for sale.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 232:
I never said she was Ronet's apprentice.
I just said she liked Ronet.
Isn't that right?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 233:
{FACE_08000A}Don't you worry, I will.
But even if you do come back with a lot
of money, I'll tell you the same thing.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 234:
{FACE_08000A}Oh, that Van's a character!{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 235:
Oh, {PETE}...{S_3201F4}
There was something I wanted to be sure
and tell you. Now what was it?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 236:
Ah!
Oh, {S_3201F4}that's right.
I have something for you.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 237:
I was cleaning out the closet when I
found one of my old watering cans.
You've got fields at your farm, right?{PAUSE}{WIPE}
So I thought I'd give it to you.
It's all right. It's still usable.
Sebastian! Sebastian!{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 238:
Will you bring the watering can that
we found in the closet over to
{PETE}'s farm?{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 239:
I used to use it for watering flowers
long ago.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
It's shaped kind of strangely,
but it's very easy to use.
I'm sure you'll like it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 240:
Thank you.{S_3201F4}
Very good.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 241:
It's nothing but an old watering can,
but I hope it'll be of some use to you.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 242:
{FACE_080000}You'll have to excuse me
for visiting you like this.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 243:
{FACE_080000}But this cat showed up at my
doorstep a while ago.{S_3201F4}
I already have two cats, you see...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But I can't bear to throw him out.{S_3201F4}
So I thought maybe you'd like to have him.
What do you think?{CHOICE2 DEF0}
Keep it.
Refuse.{EOM}{EOM}

Message 244:
{FACE_080001}Heeheehee. {S_3201F4}I knew you'd say
yes!{PAUSE}
All right. Take good care of him.
Oh, {S_3201F4}that's right.
You've got to think of a name...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 245:
{FACE_080007}Oh... {S_3201F4}But he's such a cute kitty...
I see.{S_3201F4} Oh well...{S_3201F4}
I guess we should be heading home, then.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 246:
{NAME?}? That's a good name.
Not my taste, but...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
No, no. {S_3201F4}{NAME?} is just
fine.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 247:
All right then.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 248:
Take good care of him!
Heeheehee.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 249:
Who would have thought she would have
gone before me?{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Maybe I should have challenged
{PETE} to my contest.
Then maybe she would have lived longer.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Could you be moving along?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}
