Tim: Twice a day, huh? But what about
   snacks? I can't get through the day
   without a few snacks.{PAUSE}
...Oh, Tim--you sure are a glutton!
   But cows enjoy snacks, too.
Tim: Really? I never knew that!{PAUSE}
   Cows eating snacks...imagine that!
...But no matter how much your cows love
   eating {C13}{ITEM_0004}{C17}, you have to make{PAUSE}

Tim: I'm just so irritated! Maybe all
   this stress is affecting me...
...Ooh, you've got to find a way to get{PAUSE}
   rid of stress, that's for sure.
Jim: Say, do cows ever get stressed
   like people do?{PAUSE}
...That's exactly what I wanted
   to talk about today. Yes,
   cows can feel stress, too.{PAUSE}
   When cows are stressed, they
   can become irritable and give
   less milk. If it's really bad,{PAUSE}
   they can even get sick!
Jim: Oh, I see. Poor cows! But how do
   they get so stressed out, anyway?{PAUSE}
...Well, they can get stressed when
   they're kept inside all the time or
   left outside in bad weather, or{PAUSE}
   when people mistreat them.
Tim: Just like people!
Jim: Is there a way to help cows{PAUSE}
   get rid of all of their stress?
...Well, you should let them stay
   outside when there's nice weather.{PAUSE}
   You can also brush and wash them.
   That spa treatment does wonders
   for anyone's mental health!{PAUSE}
Jim: So whatever would feel good for

Tim: How many times in a day
   will a cow give you milk?
...You can milk a cow once in{PAUSE}
   the morning and then once more,
   in the evening.
Jim: So twice a day, huh?{PAUSE}
   Cows sure are hard workers!
...And did you know, Jim, that
   cows that only give milk{PAUSE}
   after they've had a baby
   of their own?
Jim: Yep, I knew that!{PAUSE}
Tim: Really? I thought all girl
   cows could give milk once they
   got big enough. So that's not{PAUSE}
   true after all?
...A lot of people have the same
   misunderstanding, Tim.{PAUSE}
   But a human female won't make milk
   until after she has a baby, right?
Tim: Wow, and cows are just the same!{PAUSE}
...Milking a cow is very good for her
   body, too. If you go too long
   without milking her, she can{PAUSE}
   get really sick.
Tim: If she's got all that tasty milk
   ready for us, it'd be a shame to{PAUSE}
   waste any of it!
...Oh, Tim--you sure are a glutton!
   Don't be rough on the poor cow{PAUSE}

Message 39:

Today we'll be talking about how
much milk cows can give us.{PAUSE}
Jim and Tim are here with questions.
Jim: Do cows always give the same
   amount of milk?{PAUSE}
...It depends on the cow's health,
   the season, and how long it's
   been since she's given birth.{PAUSE}
Jim: Wow, the season matters, too?
...Cows give more milk in cool seasons
   than they do in hot ones.{PAUSE}
Tim: How does the time since a cow's
   had a baby affect her milk?
...Her milk will begin to run out as{PAUSE}
   days pass after she's given birth.
   In about 40 days, she'll stop giving
   milk altogether.{PAUSE}
Tim: So if you want milk all the
   time, the cow's going to have
   to have babies on a pretty{PAUSE}
   regular basis, huh?

   season to season. Am I crazy?
...Not at all, Tim! You have
   a great sense of taste.{PAUSE}
Jim: Really?! The season
   does affect its flavor?
...That's right.{PAUSE}
  The colder the season, the richer
   and tastier the milk is.
Tim: So I was right after all!{PAUSE}
   Say, there's something else I've
   been meaning to ask about...
...What's that, Tim?{PAUSE}
Tim: Baby cows drink milk,
   right? Is that the same
   milk we drink, too?{PAUSE}
   Babies need a lot of
   nutrients, don't they?
...You're pretty sharp today, Tim!{PAUSE}
   A mother cow gives special milk
   right after she has her babies.
Tim: I thought so!{PAUSE}
...For 3 days after the birth, the
   mother cow's milk is full of
   nutrients her baby needs.{PAUSE}
   Baby cows who drink this milk
   are much healthier and hardier
   than baby cows who don't.{PAUSE}
Jim: Wow, that's some important milk!
...We might take some of the mother's
   milk for our own use, but that{PAUSE}
   special milk is just for her
   and her babies. That's why you
   can't sell it.{PAUSE}
Tim: Oh, I see. So that means the milk
   I drink is different from the milk
   that baby cows drink.{PAUSE}
   ...I'd like to try that milk, though.
...I'm sure the farmer would let you
   try it if you asked nicely.{PAUSE}
Tim: Hmm, that sounds good.
   I think I'll ask the farmer the next
   time I'm at the farm.{PAUSE}

Today we're talking about birthing cows.
Jim and Tim are here with questions.{PAUSE}
Jim: How long is the baby cow inside
   the mother cow's tummy?
...I'd say about 30 days.{PAUSE}
Jim: Wow, that's a long time.
Tim: Is there a way to tell when
   the baby's ready to come out?{PAUSE}
   I'd hate to be unprepared.
...You've got a point there!
   The mother cow's udder will turn red{PAUSE}
   as her due date gets nearer.
Tim: About how many days before her
   due date does that happen?{PAUSE}
...About 6 days before, I'd say.
   While her udder is red, but before
   she has her baby, the mother cow{PAUSE}
   is going to need to take in a lot
   of nutrition for her and her baby.
   This is called “retaining milk”.{PAUSE}
   What was that again?
Both: Retaining milk!
...Good for you!{PAUSE}
   When she starts retaining milk, you
   need to stop milking her, okay?
Jim: Okay!{PAUSE}
...Also, after her udder turns red,
   you should separate the mother cow
   to protect her from the others.{PAUSE}
Tim: How do we do that?
...Just use fencing to make a
   separate pen inside the barn{PAUSE}
   for the mother cow.
Jim: Oh, is that all? That's easy!
...Just because she's in her own pen{PAUSE}
   doesn't mean you don't have to keep
   taking care of her every day!
Both: Okay!{PAUSE}
...And that's all for today!{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 42:
It's the Daily Dairy Hour!
Today we'll talk about
newborn baby cows.{PAUSE}
Jim and Tim are here with questions.
Jim: How should you handle
   a newborn baby cow?{PAUSE}
...Baby cows are very delicate.
   You especially need to be
   careful about germs.{PAUSE}
Tim: That's because it's been safe
   in its mama's belly for so long.
...You should keep the baby cow away{PAUSE}
   from other animals for a while,
   for its own protection.
Jim: Can't it stay with its mommy?{PAUSE}
   Poor baby cow...
...Well, it can, but just in case,
   wouldn't it be better if it were{PAUSE}
   safe in its own pen?
Jim: Yeah, I guess you're right.
Tim: What are you supposed to{PAUSE}
   feed a baby cow, anyway?
...For the first 6 days,
   they only drink milk.{PAUSE}
Jim: That means we have to
   milk the mother cow and
   feed her baby, huh.{PAUSE}
...Taking care of a baby cow
   is a lot of hard work.
Tim: But, but, but...{PAUSE}
   The baby cow drinks right out of
   your hand, right? Gosh, that
   wouldn't feel like work at all!{PAUSE}
...You're right about that.
   And after about 6 days, it can
   start eating {C13}{ITEM_0003}{C17}, too.{PAUSE}
   Once the baby cow can eat {C13}{ITEM_0003}{C17},
   it's almost ready for the barn.
Both: Got it!{PAUSE}

   cow mooed like that just now?{PAUSE}
Jim: Huh? You mean you can tell stuff
   like that from how they moo?
...Well, of course!{PAUSE}
Tim: Cows have lots of different moos.
...Okay, today we'll learn how to tell
   how a cow feels from its moos.{PAUSE}
   {S_3400D1}{S_3204B0}That's a normal moo.
   {S_320320}{S_3400CE}{S_3204B0}And that's a happy moo!
Jim: There really is a difference!{PAUSE}
...There is, isn't there?{S_3400D2}{S_3204B0}
Tim: That one sounded kind

cow-raising odds and ends.{PAUSE}
Jim and Tim are here with questions.
Tim: The last time I was on a farm, I{PAUSE}
   saw a cow with a star on its forehead!
   What kind of cow was that?
...That would be what's{PAUSE}
   called a Star Cow, Tim.
   They produce very high-
   quality milk.{PAUSE}
   It's good for making butter
   and cheese, too.
Jim: Oh, so they're named after{PAUSE}
   that star, huh. That's easy.
Tim: Then there was this other cow
   that looked normal except for{PAUSE}
   these spots it had. They were
   black and brownish. Is that
   another kind of cow, too?{PAUSE}
...You've got a good eye, Tim!
   The ones with the black and
   tan spots are known as{PAUSE}
   Marble Cows. This breed of
   cow produces milk that's
   best for making into cheese.{PAUSE}
Tim: So the cows with the big black
   splotches are just Normal Cows?
...That's right.{PAUSE}
   The milk from Normal Cows isn't
   as good as from other cows, but
   of all the breeds, they're the{PAUSE}
   ones that give the most milk.
Jim: What other kinds of cows are there?
...Well, there's the Brown Cow. It's{PAUSE}
   light brown all over, and its milk
   is good for making butter.
Jim: I'd like to see one of those!{PAUSE}
Tim: I want to do a taste test with all
   these different kinds of milk...

Jim: Okay!{PAUSE}
...Also, after her udder turns red,
   you should separate the mother cow
   to protect her from the others.{PAUSE}
Tim: How do we do that?
...Just use fencing to make a
   separate pen inside the barn{PAUSE}
   for the mother cow.
Jim: Oh, is that all? That's easy!
...Just because she's in her own pen{PAUSE}
   doesn't mean you don't have to keep
   taking care of her every day!
Both: Okay!{PAUSE}

Message 52:
It's the Daily Dairy Hour!
Today we'll talk about
newborn baby cows.{PAUSE}
Jim and Tim are here with questions.
Jim: How should you handle
   a newborn baby cow?{PAUSE}
...Baby cows are very delicate.
   You especially need to be
   careful about germs.{PAUSE}
Tim: That's because it's been safe
   in its mama's belly for so long.
...You should keep the baby cow away{PAUSE}
   from other animals for a while,
   for its own protection.
Jim: Can't it stay with its mommy?{PAUSE}
   Poor baby cow...
...Well, it can, but just in case,
   wouldn't it be better if it were{PAUSE}
   safe in its own pen?
Jim: Yeah, I guess you're right.
Tim: What are you supposed to{PAUSE}
   feed a baby cow, anyway?
...For the first 6 days,
   they only drink milk.{PAUSE}
Jim: That means we have to
   milk the mother cow and
   feed her baby, huh.{PAUSE}
...Taking care of a baby cow
   is a lot of hard work.
Tim: But, but, but...{PAUSE}
   The baby cow drinks right out of
   your hand, right? Gosh, that
   wouldn't feel like work at all!{PAUSE}
...You're right about that.
   And after about 6 days, it can
   start eating {C13}{ITEM_0003}{C17}, too.{PAUSE}
   Once the baby cow can eat {C13}{ITEM_0003}{C17},
   it's almost ready for the barn.
Both: Got it!{PAUSE}
...And that's all for today!{EOM}

....................................{PAUSE}
Jim: I can hear them mooing!
...Say, Jim, do you know why that
   cow mooed like that just now?{PAUSE}
Jim: Huh? You mean you can tell stuff
   like that from how they moo?
...Well, of course!{PAUSE}
Tim: Cows have lots of different moos.
...Okay, today we'll learn how to tell
   how a cow feels from its moos.{PAUSE}
   {S_3400D1}{S_3204B0}That's a normal moo.
   {S_320320}{S_3400CE}{S_3204B0}And that's a happy moo!
Jim: There really is a difference!{PAUSE}
...There is, isn't there?{S_3400D2}{S_3204B0}
Tim: That one sounded kind
   of sad somehow...{PAUSE}

Today we'll be talking about some
cow-raising odds and ends.{PAUSE}
Jim and Tim are here with questions.
Tim: The last time I was on a farm, I{PAUSE}
   saw a cow with a star on its forehead!
   What kind of cow was that?
...That would be what's{PAUSE}
   called a Star Cow, Tim.
   They produce very high-
   quality milk.{PAUSE}
   It's good for making butter
   and cheese, too.
Jim: Oh, so they're named after{PAUSE}
   that star, huh. That's easy.
Tim: Then there was this other cow
   that looked normal except for{PAUSE}
   these spots it had. They were
   black and brownish. Is that
   another kind of cow, too?{PAUSE}
...You've got a good eye, Tim!
   The ones with the black and
   tan spots are known as{PAUSE}
   Marble Cows. This breed of
   cow produces milk that's
   best for making into cheese.{PAUSE}
Tim: So the cows with the big black
   splotches are just Normal Cows?
...That's right.{PAUSE}
   The milk from Normal Cows isn't
   as good as from other cows, but
   of all the breeds, they're the{PAUSE}
   ones that give the most milk.
Jim: What other kinds of cows are there?
...Well, there's the Brown Cow. It's{PAUSE}
   light brown all over, and its milk
   is good for making butter.
Jim: I'd like to see one of those!{PAUSE}
Tim: I want to do a taste test with all
   these different kinds of milk...
...Oh, Tim--you sure are a glutton!{PAUSE}
...And that's all for today!{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Ron: Will seeds sprout just anywhere?

Ron: So what's a field like, anyway?{PAUSE}

   You use a hoe to till furrows into
   the soil and plant your seeds there.{PAUSE}
Jon: Will every kind of seed

Ron: How do I do that?
...Just fill a watering can with water
   and sprinkle it over the seeds.{PAUSE}
Jon: How much water do they need?
...Watch the soil. When it starts looking
   dry, it's time to water again.{PAUSE}
Jon: What if I forget?
...Your seeds won't sprout, and
   your crops will wither up.{PAUSE}
   That's why you have to water your
