I wonder what {TATSUYA} is
interested in these days...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
I bet if you showed that kid a
bunch of different things, it might
make {TATSUYA} interested in them.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 347:
{NICKNAME}, have you been talking
to {TATSUYA} recently?{CHOICE Y/N DEF0}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 348:
Well, that's good.
But I think that kid is in a rebellious
phase...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 349:
Maybe you should leave the kid alone.
It's just a phase.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 350:
It may seem strange for me to say this
now, but I don't help out with the work
much, do I? What do you think of that?
{CHOICE3 DEF1}
Don't worry about it.
You're a lazy old man.
I've given up on you.{EOM}

Message 351:
Really? That makes me feel better.
It's been bothering me, but I'm really
not cut out for this kind of work.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 352:
I suppose you're right.
{TATSUYA} probably thinks so, too.
But I have to be myself...{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 353:
Um... I see...
That's a little harsh. But I guess
nothing can be done about it.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 354:
Have I mellowed out since we got married?
Celia said that I had. She said I talk
more gently nowadays.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 355:
I'd like to help out with the farm work
every once in a while.
I probably can't do much, but...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 356:
I hope {TATSUYA} grows up healthy
and happy. Well, any child with your genes
should be fine.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 357:
Having our kid grow up means that we'll
have more time for the two of us, but
it's kind of lonely, too.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 358:
Oh, hello.
You come here often, too?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 359:
I just stopped by for a minute.
I'll be going home soon.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 360:
Even a guy like me likes to stop
and talk with people sometimes.
Of course, I mostly listen...{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 361:
On days like this, I like to get outside
as much as possible.
It feels good and it's good for you.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 362:
Vesta plants Tomatoes, Watermelon,
and Potatoes at this time of year.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 363:
It's so nice out, I was just
taking a little break.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 364:
You taking a walk, too?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 365:
It's a little hot, but
it feels really good in the shade
of the trees.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 366:
I used to swim in the ocean all
the time. But nobody swims here.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 367:
Vesta plants Melons, Watermelons, and
Turnips at this time of year.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 368:
Vesta plants Melons, Yams, and
Turnips at this time of year.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 369:
It's a little chilly...
Where are you off to?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 370:
When I'm walking somewhere I'm
usually thinking about something.
About what? Oh, lots of stuff.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 371:
This is a tough season for the crops.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 372:
Vesta plants Strawberries, Potatoes,
and Carrots at this time of year.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 373:
I'm not much of a cook.
Could you dish up something for me?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 374:
Celia used to mess up all the time when
she was cooking. Do you have that problem?
{CHOICE3 DEF1}
Leave the cooking to me!
That depends on your definition of “mess.”
If you don't like it, FINE!{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 375:
{FACE_1E0003}I'm looking forward to it.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 376:
Well, I'll eat anything you want to
cook me.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 377:
{FACE_1E0009}S-sorry.
I didn't mean anything by it...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 378:
Sometimes I think I might like to try
my hand at cooking...{PAUSE}{WIPE}
But don't worry.
I'll eat the stuff I cook myself.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 379:
Vesta likes baking bread and pastries
more than cooking.
Are you like that?{CHOICE Y/N DEF0}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 380:
I see...
I'm not very big on sweets, though...{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 381:
That's good.
I don't like sweets very much.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 382:
I've learned how to cook a bit
recently.
I'm not as good as you, of course.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 383:
When you're not here, I eat the
food in the refrigerator, so try
and keep it stocked, OK?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 384:
I wonder what kind of cooking
{TATSUYA} likes...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 385:
{TATSUYA} is eating a lot lately.
Growing kids'll do that.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 386:
Everything we cook should be great.
We use the best ingredients, after all.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 387:
I wonder what {TATSUYA} wants
to be in the future...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 388:
{TATSUYA} seems to be keeping
a diary. Have you looked at it?
I suppose we shouldn't read it, but...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 389:
It might be best for you to stay out
of {TATSUYA}'s room for a while.
Older kids need their privacy...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 390:
When I look at {TATSUYA}'s room,
I remember when that kid was just a baby.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 391:
If you look at {TATSUYA}'s toy box
and bookshelves, I think you can tell
what that kid's interested in.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 392:
I guess adults can't appreciate what
kids really find valuable...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 393:
{TATSUYA} seems to be
reading a lot of pretty difficult
books recently.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 394:
I guess we can't just walk
into {TATSUYA}'s room without
knocking anymore.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 395:
Our kid's room is always
going to be a kid's room to me...
Well, I guess that's natural...{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 396:
I like to come here and look at the
fields occasionally. I might learn
something we can use on our farm...{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 397:
Did you come to buy some seeds?
Then you'd better ask Vesta or
Celia.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 398:
This is where we raise stable crop
varieties for shipping to the city.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 399:
I made that scarecrow over there.
We didn't really need it, though.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 400:
Zzzzzzz.......{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 401:
Zzzzzz... Zzzz...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 402:
The room seems kind of empty
without a bed in it...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 403:
Do you watch TV a lot?
{CHOICE3 DEF1}
All the time.
Occasionally.
Never.{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 404:
So, you're a couch potato, eh?
I don't watch it much myself.
Is it really that good?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 405:
I guess there are some programs about
farming... I wonder if they're any good...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 406:
Then what do we have one for?{PAUSE}
Not just for its looks, is it?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 407:
You know, we've got a pretty big house
for just three people...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 408:
The quality of the soil is different
from field to field.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 409:
I don't think I'm cut out for farm work,
but I am interested in crops.
I'm researching hybridization.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 410:
Hybridization is when you take the genes of
two plants and make a third, new plant.
It can be pretty interesting.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
For example, if you combined a Tomato and
a Watermelon, you'd get a {CROP_0005}
that has both of their genes.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
Or if you combined a Melon and a
Strawberry, you'd get a {CROP_000A}
that has both of their genes.{PAUSE}{WIPE}
And if you combine the {CROP_0005} and the
{CROP_000A}, you get something that has
genes from all of those plants.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 411:
Daryl may be researching hybrids too,
but he's such a weird guy and all.
Who knows what he's up to?{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 412:
I'd like to help you out by coming
up with some good new crops
on my own.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 413:
This is a good place for a pasture.
It gets plenty of sun and wind.
Yep, it's just about perfect...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 414:
I love to watch the grass bend and wave
in the wind.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 415:
{FACE_1E0009}I think I'd better pass for now.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 416:
Where are you off to in this rain?
It's not good for your health.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 417:
I don't feel like going out on days like
this... But being cooped up inside
all day is boring...{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 418:
I can care for the tools and the
the freezer, you know...
I don't mind giving Takakura a hand.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 419:
I thought I might do a little
cleaning around here.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 420:
I can't really take care of the animals,
but I can at least clean up after them.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 421:
If we don't keep the barn clean, the
animals could become ill.{PAUSE}{EOM}

Message 422:
What's up?
I just thought I'd come and have a
chat with Takakura.{PAUSE}{EOM}{EOM}

Message 423:
I thought I'd ask Takakura to teach me
about the farm.{PAUSE}{EOM}
