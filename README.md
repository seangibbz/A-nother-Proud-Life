# Harvest Moon: A(nother) Proud Life
HM:A(n)PL is a mod for *Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life* and *Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful life* aimed at allowing same-sex relationships.

This repo is to serve as a way to track changes I make to files (i.e. dislogue) for the purpose of this mod.

## Dialogue
While many dialogue files have names refering to their character in game, a number of files have names that differ from their corresponding characters.

This is likely due to differences in character names during localization.

The names that differ between in-game and filename include the following:
